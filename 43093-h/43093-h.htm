<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p>Before I allude to the road as it is, let
me refer to what it was, and in so doing
bring my classical lore into play. Pelops was
a coachman, who has been immortalised for his
ability to drive at the rate of fourteen miles
an hour by the first of Grecian bards. Despite
his ivory arm, he got the whip-hand of &OElig;nomaus,
a brother "dragsman" in their celebrated
chariot-race from Pisa to the Corinthian
Isthmus, owing more to the rascality of the
state coachman, Myrtilus, whom he bribed to
furnish his master, the King of Pisa, with an
old carriage, the axletree of which broke
on the course, than to his own coaching
merits.</p>

<p>Hippolytus, too, "handled the ribbons well,"
but "came to grief" by being overturned near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the sea-shore, when flying from the resentment
of his father. His horses were so frightened
at the noise of sea-calves, which Neptune had
purposely sent there, that they ran among the
rocks till his chariot was broken and his body
torn to pieces.</p>

<p>Virgil and Horace sang the praises and commemorated
the honours of the "whips" of their
day. Juvenal tells us of a Roman Consul who
aspired to be a "dragsman"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i9h">                        "Volueri</div>
<div class="line">Carpento rapitur pinguis Damasippus; et ipse</div>
<div class="line">Ipse rotam stringit multo sufflamine Consul."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, I find the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum</div>
<div class="line i0h">Collegisse juvat metaque fervidis</div>
<div class="line i0h">Evitata rotis, palmaque nobilis</div>
<div class="line i0h">Terrarum dominos evehit ad Deos."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Which may be thus rendered&mdash;"The summit
of some men's ambition is to drive four-in-hand."</p>

<p>Propertius, too, exclaims against the tandem
as rivalling the curricle&mdash;that is, according to
some witty translators:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Invide tu <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tandem</i> voces compesce molestas.</div>
<div class="line i0h">Et sine nos cursu quo sumus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ire pares</i>."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Horace writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tandem</i> parcas insane;"</p>

<p>and to those who drive this dangerous vehicle
the following line may not be inappropriate:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tandem</i> discedere campis admonuit."</p>

<p>In addition to the above classical names,
there were, early in the present century, hundreds
of whips who raised the character of
coachmen to the highest pinnacle of fame. Let
me instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>Richard Vaughan, of the Cambridge "Telegraph,"
'scientific in horseflesh, unequalled in
driving;' Pears, of the Southampton day
coach; Wood, Liley, Wilcocks, and Hayward
of the "Wonder," between London and Shrewsbury;
Charles Holmes, of the Blenheim coach;
Izaac Walton, the Mæcenas of whips, the
Braham of the Bath road; Jack Adams, the
civil and obliging pastor, who taught the young
Etonians to drive; Bramble, Faulkner, Dennis,
Cross, and others, all of whom have long since
departed this life.</p>

<p>Many professional stage-coachmen were men
of good education. Indeed, not a few had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
received the advantage of a college education,
and could quote Latin and Greek in a manner
that surprised some of their companions. They
could also tell a good story and sing a good
song; so that their society was much sought
after, both on the box and in the snug bar-parlour.</p>

<p>I will not here stop to discuss the question
of rail and road, or to lament that the "Light
(coaches) of other days has faded," although
many a man's heart sinks to the axle when
he thinks of the past, and feels disposed to
sympathise with Jerry Drag, "him wot drove,"
I quote his own words, "the old Highflyer,
Red Rover, and Markiss of Huntley."</p>

<p>"Them as 'ave seen coaches," says this
knight of the ribbons, "afore rails came into
fashion, 'ave seen something worth remembering;
them was happy days for Old England, afore
reform and rails turned everything upside down,
and men rode as natur' intended they should,
on pikes with coaches and smart, active cattle,
and not by machinery, like bags of cotton
and hardware; but coaches is done for ever,
and a heavy blow it is. They was the pride
of the country, there wasn't anything like
them, as I've heerd gemmen say from forrin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
parts, to be found nowhere, nor never will be
again."</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais revenons à nos moutons</i>; my present
object is to compare coaching as it is with
coaching as it was.</p>

<p>It may not here be uninteresting to mention
that coaches were introduced into England by
Fitz Allan, Earl of Arundel, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1580, before
which time Queen Elizabeth, on public occasions,
rode behind her chamberlain; and she,
in her old age, used reluctantly such an effeminate
conveyance. They were at first drawn
by only two horses; but, as a writer of those
days remarks, "The rest crept in by degrees,
as man at first ventured to sea."</p>

<p>Historians, however, differ upon this subject,
for it is stated by Stow (that ill-used antiquary,
who, after a long laborious life, was
left by his countrymen to beg his bread) that
in 1564, Booner, a Dutchman, became the
Queen's coachman, and was the first that
brought the use of coaches into England;
while Anderson, in his "History of Commerce,"
says, on the other hand, that about
1580 the use of coaches was introduced by the
Earl of Arundel.</p>

<p>It was Buckingham, the favourite, who about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
1619 began to have a team of six horses,
which "was wondered at as a novelty, and
imputed to him as a mastering pride." Before
that time ladies chiefly rode on horseback&mdash;either
single, on their palfreys, or double,
behind some person, on a pillion. A considerable
time elapsed before this luxurious way of
locomotion was enjoyed by more than a very
few rich and distinguished individuals, and a
very much longer time before coaches became
general.</p>

<p>In the year 1672, at which period throughout
the kingdom there were only six stage-coaches
running, a pamphlet was written and
published by Mr. John Cresset, of the Charterhouse,
urging their suppression; and amongst
the grave reasons given against their continuance
was the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These stage-coaches make gentlemen come
to London on every small occasion, which
otherwise they would not do but upon urgent
necessity; nay, the convenience of the passage
makes their wives often come up, who, rather
than come such long journeys on horseback,
would stay at home. Then when they come
to town they must presently be in the mode,
get fine clothes, go to plays and treats, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
by these means, get such a habit of idleness
and love of pleasure as makes them uneasy ever
after."</p>

<p>What would Mr. Cresset have said had he
lived some forty years ago, in the palmy days
of coaching&mdash;coaches full, able dragsmen, spicy
teams, doing their eleven miles an hour with
ease, without breaking into a gallop or turning
a hair? Or how surprised would the
worthy chronicler of 1672 be at the present
annihilators of time and space&mdash;the railroads,
when "the convenience of the passage" enables
parties to come up to London from Liverpool,
Birmingham, Manchester, Bath, and
Bristol in time for the play or opera,
and return home for dinner the following
day.</p>

<p>In 1739 Pennant writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I travelled in the Chester stage to London,
then no despicable vehicle for country
gentlemen. The first day, with much labour,
we got from Chester to Whitchurch (twenty
miles), the second day to the Welsh Harp,
the third to Coventry, the fourth to Northampton,
the fifth to Dunstable, and, as a wondrous
effort, on the last to London, before
the commencement of the night. The strain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and labour of six horses, sometimes eight,
drew us through the slough of Mireden and
many other places. We were constantly out
two hours before day, and as many at night.
Families who could afford to travel in their
own carriages contracted with Benson and Co.,
and were dragged up in the same number of
days by three sets of able horses."</p>

<p>These coaches must have been not only
very lumbering, but very dangerous conveyances,
as the following newspaper paragraph,
dated the 2nd of September, 1770, will
prove:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It were greatly to be wished that stage-coaches
were put under some regulation as
to the number of persons and quantity of
luggage carried by them. Thirty-four persons
were in and about the Hertford coach this
day, which broke down, by one of the traces
giving way. One outside passenger was killed
on the spot, a woman had both legs broken;
very few of the number, either within or without,
but were severely bruised."</p>

<p>Rich or poor, high or low, prior to this were
obliged either to walk or ride in the same
manner that Queen Elizabeth did from Greenwich
to London, behind her Lord Chancellor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Queen Victoria is a graceful horsewoman. Previous
to the lamented decease of the Prince
Consort, Her Majesty constantly appeared on
horseback, and for all we know to the contrary,
Lord Cairns is able to "match the world with
noble horsemanship;" still we think that such
an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i> into London as that performed by the
Virgin Queen would surprise the weak minds of
the present generation.</p>

<p>One can scarcely now realize the state of things
when a passenger starting by the waggon from
the metropolis at five o'clock in the morning,
did not arrive at Blackheath until half-past nine.
For four hours and a half were the unfortunate
travellers tossed, tumbled, jumbled, and rumbled
over a road full of holes and wheel-ruts, out of
which extra horses were employed to drag
the lumbering vehicle. Break-downs(not the
popular dance of that name) were frequent;
much time was occupied in repairing the
waggons, and it often happened that, when a
wheelwright could not be got, the road was
blocked up by a broken-down vehicle.</p>

<p>Macaulay tells us that, during the year which
immediately followed the Restoration, a diligence
ran between London and Oxford in two
days. The passengers slept at Beaconsfield.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
At length, in the Spring of 1669, a great and
daring innovation was attempted. It was announced
that a vehicle, described as the flying
coach, would perform the whole journey between
sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p>"This spirited undertaking was solemnly considered
and sanctioned by the heads of the
University, and appears to have excited the
same sort of interest which is excited in our
own time by the opening of a new railway.
The Vice-Chancellor, by a notice which was
affixed in all public places, prescribed the hour
and place of departure.</p>

<p>"The success of this experiment was complete.
At six in the morning the carriage began to
move from before the ancient front of All
Souls' College, and at seven in the evening the
adventurous gentlemen who had run the first
risk were safely deposited at their inn in London.
The emulation of the sister University was
moved, and soon a diligence was set up which
in one day carried passengers from Cambridge
to the Capital."</p>

<p>In 1678 a contract was made to establish
a coach for passengers between Edinburgh
and Glasgow, a distance of forty-four miles.
This coach was drawn by six horses, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
journey between the two places, to and fro, was
completed in six days.</p>

<p>At the close of the reign of Charles II. flying
carriages ran thrice a week from London to all
the chief towns; but no stage-coach appears
to have proceeded further north than York, or
further west than Exeter. The ordinary day's
journey of a flying coach was about fifty miles
in the Summer; but in Winter, when the ways
were bad and the nights long, little more than
thirty miles.</p>

<p>The Chester coach, the York coach, and the
Exeter coach generally reached London in four
days during the fine season, but at Christmas
not till the sixth day. The passengers, six in
number, were all seated in the carriage; for
accidents were so frequent that it would have
been most perilous to mount the roof. The
ordinary fare was about twopence half-penny
a mile in Summer, and somewhat more in
Winter.</p>

<p>"This mode of travelling, which by Englishmen
of the present day would be regarded as
insufferably slow, seemed to our ancestors wonderfully,
and indeed alarmingly rapid; for, in
a work published a few months before the death
of Charles II., the flying coaches are extolled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
as far superior to any similar vehicles ever
known in the world. Their velocity is the
subject of special commendation, and is triumphantly
contrasted with the sluggish pace of
the Continental posts. But with boasts like
these was mingled the sound of complaint and
invective.</p>

<p>"The interest of large classes had been unfavourably
affected by the establishment of the
new diligences, and, as usual, many persons
were, from mere stupidity and obstinacy, disposed
to clamour against the innovation. It
was vehemently argued that this mode of conveyance
would be fatal to the breed of horses
and to the noble art of horsemanship; that the
Thames, which had long been an important
nursery of seamen, would cease to be the chief
thoroughfare from London up to Windsor, and
down to Gravesend; that saddlers and spurriers
would be ruined by hundreds; that numerous
inns at which mounted travellers had been in
the habit of stopping would be deserted, and
could no longer pay any rent; that the new
carriages were too hot in Summer and too cold
in Winter; that the passengers were grievously
annoyed by invalids and crying children; that
the coach sometimes reached the inn so late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
that it was impossible to get supper, and sometimes
started so early that it was impossible to
get breakfast.</p>

<p>"On these grounds it was gravely recommended
that no public carriage should be permitted to
have more than four horses, to start oftener
than once a week, or to go more than thirty
miles a day. It was hoped that, if this regulation
were adopted, all except the sick and the
lame would return to the old modes of travelling
on horseback and by water. Petitions embodying
such opinions as these were presented
to the King in Council from several companies
of the City of London, from several provincial
towns, and from the justices of several counties."</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine the exact period
at which a stage-coach first appeared upon the
road, for there is a wide difference between
the stage-coach of the last century and the
flying coaches of the previous one. Although
the stage-coach may have improved in speed,
its discomfort still existed, as may be gleaned
from the following lines written by Dean
Swift on his journey from London to
Chester:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>As Dean Swift died in 1745, at the green old
age of seventy-eight, the above lines were probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
written about the close of the previous
century; and certainly not much progress was
made for the comfort of passengers, as I can
myself bear testimony. I well remember the
lumbering, slow coach that used to convey me
from London to Chichester thrice a year, when the
holidays from Westminster came about. It
started at five o'clock in the morning, reaching
its destination late in the evening, six inside
passengers being stuffed in a small space capable
of holding four comfortably. At all the hills&mdash;and
there are plenty on this road&mdash;we were
politely asked to descend from the vehicle, as
the wretched horses could scarcely drag their
heavy load even on level ground. It was always
considered in those days dangerous to mount
the roof; still any risk was better than being
stifled inside, and often have I, despite the
inclemency of the weather, taken the box seat,
getting thoroughly wet through before half my
journey had been accomplished.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a witticism of a guard who,
being told by a passenger that he had tried every
sort of waterproof coat, but that nothing would
keep him dry,</p>

<p>"Why, then," said the other, "don't you
invest a penny in a Yarmouth bloater? Eat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
that, and I warrant you'll be dry all
day?"</p>

<p>None except those who have been victims to
the misery of inside berths can imagine the
wretchedness of them&mdash;a coach licensed to carry
six inside&mdash;for so small was the space, so low
was the roof, that the legs of the inmates were
cramped, and their backs doubled up. Then
the atmosphere was most oppressive&mdash;forty,
sometimes fifty, stone of human beings huddled
together, with both windows up. Again, the
occupants&mdash;occasionally a fat nurse and a squalling
baby; a farmer, rude in health and manners;
a painted old Jezebel, redolent of Macassar oil
and patchouli; a fledgling dandy, strong of
musk; a bloated publican, on the verge of
delirium tremens, who, as the old song says,
"kept his spirits up by pouring spirits down;"
a snuffy old maid, whose nasal organ was so
supplied with "lundyfoot" that it set her
companions sneezing immoderately. Then the
inside passengers were to be fed, and a
strong odour of cheese, apples, oranges,
cakes, brandy, rum, gin, beer prevailed everywhere.</p>

<p>Often in my early days have I travelled from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
London to Brighthelmstone (now called Brighton)
in a coach thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lewes and Brighthelmstone&mdash;new machine
to hold four persons, by Charley, sets out by
the 'George Inn,' in the Haymarket, St. James's
at six o'clock in the morning, every Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, in one day to the 'Star'
at Lewes, and the 'Old Ship' at Brighthelmstone,
and returns from there every Tuesday, Thursday,
and Saturday. Inside passengers to Lewes
to pay thirteen shillings; to Brighthelmstone,
sixteen shillings. To be allowed fourteen
pounds weight of baggage, all above to pay
one penny per pound."</p>

<p>The above was a great improvement upon a
coach previously drawn by six long-tailed black
horses, thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Batchelor's Old Godstone, East Grinstead,
and Lewes stage continues to set out every
Tuesday at nine o'clock and Saturday at five
o'clock from the 'Talbot Inn', in the Borough,
returning every Monday and Thursday. Children
in lap and outside passengers to pay half
price. Half of the fare to be paid at booking.
Performed, if God permit, by J.
Batchelor."</p>

<p>I may here remind my readers that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
when the Prince Regent, afterwards George
IV., selected Brighton, as a marine residence,
and squandered thousands and thousands of
pounds upon the Pavilion, the journey from
London to this then small fishing town occupied
two days; the first night being passed at
Reigate or at Cuckfield, according to the road
the stage travelled.</p>

<p>About seventy-five years ago an attempt was
made to run through in one day, and, to the
surprise of many, was accomplished; but it was
not until 1823 that the Brighton road became
(what it continued to be until the rail was
introduced) the first in England for well-appointed
coaches, first-rate teams, and gentleman-like
drivers.</p>

<p>Harry Stevenson, who was educated at Cambridge,
was the first to introduce the fast light
coach, called the "Waterwitch," and truly did he
"<em>witch</em> the world with noble <em>coach</em>manship."
After a time this beau-ideal of dragsmen started
another coach in lieu of the "Waterwitch," which
he called the "Age," and which was unrivalled.
Who that ever saw that fancy team, the skewbald,
dun, chestnut, and roan, sightly and full
of action, leave the Castle Square, witnessed that
which never has been and never can be equalled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
in this or in any other country. With Stevenson
commenced the rage for driving public conveyances
by noblemen and gentlemen, to which I
shall refer in a future chapter.</p>

<p>It may here not be out of place to lay before
my readers a statement of the working of the
stage-coaches in bygone days. In 1742 a stage-coach
left London for Oxford at seven o'clock
in the morning, and reached Uxbridge at midday.
It arrived at High Wycombe at five in the
evening, where it rested for the night, and proceeded
at the same rate for the seat of learning
on the morrow. Here, then, were ten hours
consumed each day in travelling twenty-seven
miles, and nearly two days in performing what
was afterwards done under six hours by the
"Defiance" and other coaches. To go from London
to York used to take six days.</p>

<p>In 1784 I read of the Edinburgh diligence,
horsed with a pair, which set off daily from the
"Saracen's Head," in the Gallowgate, Glasgow, at
seven o'clock in the morning, and arrived at
Edinburgh at eight o'clock at night. This conveyance
stopped at Cumbernauld for an hour
and a half in order to give the passengers time
for breakfast, and again for the same time at
Linlithgow for dinner. A third stoppage took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
place in order that the passengers might enjoy
their tea, when they again proceeded on their
road, and were finally set down safely in
the Grassmarket of Edinburgh at eight o'clock
at night.</p>

<p>About this period there was a ponderous
machine with six broad wheels, and drawn by
eight horses, called the Newcastle waggon. In
addition to passengers, it generally carried a
great portion of the Glasgow linen and cotton
manufactures to the London market. It travelled
at the rate of twenty-five miles a day, and was
three weeks upon the road between Glasgow
and London, resting always upon the Sundays.
At that time the best mode of conveyance from
Glasgow to the English capital was by a trading
vessel from Borrowstounness; and so remarkable
was a sight of London considered in Glasgow,
that a worthy citizen who bore the same
Christian and surname as another friend was,
after his return from London, distinguished as
"London John."</p>

<p>The use of stage-coaches rapidly extended itself,
and there was scarcely a town through
which some stage-coach did not pass. After a
time, the heavy six-inside lumbering vehicle gave
way to the light four-inside fast coach; and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
the year 1825 until the introduction of railways,
nothing could exceed the "turns out" on the
principal roads. In 1833 the distance between
London and Shrewsbury (one hundred and fifty-four
miles), Exeter (one hundred and seventy-one
miles), and Manchester (one hundred and
eighty-seven miles) was done in a day. The
Mail to Holyhead performed the journey (two
hundred and sixty-one miles) in twenty-seven
hours, and that to Liverpool (two hundred and
three miles) in twenty-one hours. The journey
to Brighton was accomplished at the rate of
twelve miles an hour, including stoppages, and
the Bath, Bristol, Southampton, Oxford, and
Cambridge coaches were famed for their excellent
arrangements.</p>

<p>In 1807 one of the Stamford stage-coaches
that daily ran to London performed the journey
(ninety-nine miles) in nine hours and four
minutes from the time of starting; although the
passengers were allowed time to breakfast and
dine upon the road. The coach must necessarily
have run at the rate of twelve miles an
hour.</p>

<p>The fast coach had nearly a horse to every
mile of ground it ran, reckoning one way, or
"one side of the ground"&mdash;for example, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
London to Shrewsbury the distance is one hundred
and fifty-eight miles, and the number of
horses kept for the "Wonder" coach was one
hundred and fifty.</p>

<p>The average price of horses for these coaches
was about £23. Fancy teams, and those working
out of London, were rated considerably higher;
but, taking a hundred miles of ground, well
horsed, the above was about the mark. In
these days it would be nearly if not quite
double. The average period of each horse's
service did not exceed four years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p>In the days I write of, Macaulay tells us that
the mounted highwayman, a marauder
known to the present generation only from
books, was to be found on every main road.
Hounslow Heath on the Great Western Road,
Finchley Common on the Great Northern Road,
were, perhaps, the most celebrated of these
spots; but there was hardly an open common
or steep hill which was not infested with these
enterprising plunderers.</p>

<p>Upon two occasions I fell in with these
gentlemen of the road. Once, when travelling
in very early youth from London to Goodwood,
the Chichester coach was stopped by two ill-favoured
scoundrels, who were about to levy
black mail on the inside passengers, when,
fortunately, the sound of a travelling-carriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
was heard, and thinking, probably, that the
inmates of it might be armed, the robbers
scampered off.</p>

<p>The second adventure occurred to me when
returning very late at night from Tunbridge
Wells in a dennet with my trusty batman, John
Hargreaves, by my side. We were ascending
the hill that leads into Sevenoaks, my servant
walking up it and I driving, when I heard a
shrill whistle from one side of the road, which
was immediately responded to. Anticipating
some mischief, I said "Jump in," and, obedient
to orders, Hargreaves did so.</p>

<p>Happily, we had reached the summit of the
hill, when one man rushed forward and attempted
to seize the horse's bridle, while another tried
to hang on behind the gig. Hargreaves had
my stick in his hand, a good ash plant, with
which he struck the fellow a blow across the
face, which made him relax his hold, while I
gave a smart lash of the whip to my most
willing horse, who started off at a tremendous
pace down the hill, leaving my assailant sprawling
on the ground, and within an inch of having
his head run over by the wheel.</p>

<p>"Stage-coach robberies were of daily occurrence,
and it was generally supposed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
they were connived at by many innkeepers;
so much so, indeed, that proclamations were
issued warning all innkeepers that the eye of
the Government was upon them. Their criminal
connivance, it was affirmed, enabled banditti
to infest the roads with impunity. That those
suspicions were not without foundation is proved
by the dying speeches of some penitent robbers
of that age, who appear to have received from
the innkeepers services much resembling
those which Farquhar's 'Boniface' rendered to
'Gibbet.'"</p>

<p>In the "Domestic Intelligence" I read that
"several passengers, both men and women, to
the number of fifteen, going in three or four
coaches towards Bath and Bristol, were set
upon by some highwaymen (supposed to be
soldiers) well armed, about Stoke Church, in
Oxfordshire (a very desolate part at that time),
who robbed them all of very considerable
value."</p>

<p>Another adventure may not prove uninteresting.
Two travellers were journeying together
over a dreary common, when one remarked to
the other that he trusted they should not fall
in with any highwaymen, as he had one hundred
pounds secreted in his boot. They had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
not gone many miles before they came to a
most secluded spot, where four cross roads
met; the new-laid earth round the finger-post,
and a gibbet at some little distance,
with a skeleton body suspended in chains to
it, showed that two human beings had met
with ignominious deaths. They had been companions
in crime, and in robbing the Mail the
guard had been killed.</p>

<p>An offer of a free pardon and two hundred
pounds reward had been proclaimed, when one
of the wretches, actuated by vile lucre, turned
King's evidence, and sacrificed his friend.
Although he had taken part in the robbery,
as he did not fire the fatal shot, his pardon was
granted and the blood money awarded him. On
the morning of the execution of his partner
in guilt, remorse seized hold of the informer,
and by his own hand he rid the country of a
villain.</p>

<p>The two travellers, who, I ought to say,
had met accidentally at an inn, reached the
spot I have described; the wind whistled across
the heath&mdash;the chains of the gibbet clanked, the
birds of carrion hovered over the new-made
grave, in which the suicide had been buried, and
the body of the murderer dangled in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
As they passed the grave of the suicide,
three men suddenly rushed forward, determined,
as they swore, with a dreadful imprecation,
to have the money or the lives of the
travellers.</p>

<p>"Spare our lives! Take all I have!" cried
one. "Here it is!" offering a handful of
silver.</p>

<p>"That won't do!" responded the highwayman.
"I'll soon see what you have about
you!"</p>

<p>"Stay!" said the other. "My companion
has our money hid away in his boot."</p>

<p>"Traitor!" exclaimed his companion, while
one of the gang, with blackened face and
cocked pistol, proceeded to take off the boots
of the terrified victim.</p>

<p>"If you've spoken false," shouted the first,
"I'll give you an ounce of lead for your
pains."</p>

<p>"He has spoken truth," responded the
searcher. "Here's a prize&mdash;a hundred pounds
in Bank of England notes!"</p>

<p>Securing the money, the two travellers were
blindfolded and bound to the finger-post, while
the horse was taken out of their gig and turned
loose on the common. It was nearly an hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
before they were released from their position,
during which period the ill-used victim vented
his anger pretty loudly.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the next town where a deposition
was made before a magistrate, the worthy
Justice commented in rather a severe strain
upon the base conduct of the miscreant who
had acted so treacherous a part.</p>

<p>"Hear my palliation," meekly said the accused.</p>

<p>"Stand down; I've heard enough;" vociferated
the man in authority.</p>

<p>"One word," continued the other. "My
object was not to screen myself at another's
expense. My companion told me he had one
hundred pounds in his boot; I had twelve
hundred pounds in my waistband. Had I been
searched, that must have been discovered, and
would probably have led to my companion
being searched; so I thought it better to sacrifice
the smaller to the larger sum. I now
return the money I was the means of his
being deprived of, and in future recommend
him to be more prudent in keeping his
own counsel."</p>

<p>One more anecdote of the road must suffice:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Early in the present century a rider for a
mercantile house in the City of London was
attacked a few miles beyond Winchester, by
a highwayman, who, taking him by surprise,
robbed him of his purse and pocket-book,
containing cash and notes to a considerable
amount.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the rider, with great presence
of mind, "I have suffered you to take my
property, and you are welcome to it. It is my
master's, and the loss of it cannot do him
much harm; but, as it will look very cowardly
in me to have been robbed without making
any resistance, I should take it kindly
of you just to fire a pistol through my
coat."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," replied the highwayman;
"where will you have the ball?"</p>

<p>"Here," said the rider, "just by the side
of the button."</p>

<p>The highwayman was as good as his word,
but the moment he fired the rider knocked
him off his horse; and, having stunned him
with the blow, aided by a labourer who came
up at the time, lodged him safely in Winchester
Gaol.</p>

<p>As late as the year 1814 stage-coach robberies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
continued, for I find in 1814 the Stroud Mail
was robbed of bank-notes to the amount of
two thousand eight hundred pounds; and in
the following year the Buckingham stage-coach
was robbed of bills and notes to a considerable
amount.</p>

<p>Occasionally the victims of a robbery advertised
for the loss of any valued article, as will
be seen by the following whimsical and good-humoured
appeal extracted from Salisbury's
"Flying Post" of Oct. 27, 1696:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whereas six gentlemen (all of the same
honourable profession), having been more than
ordinary put to it for a little pocket money, did,
on the 14th instant, in the evening, near Kentish
Town, borrow of two persons (in a coach) a
certain sum of money, without staying to give
bond for the repayment, and whereas fancy was
taken to the hat, peruke, cravat, sword, and
cane of one of the creditors, which were all lent
as freely as the money; these are, therefore, to
desire the said worthies, how fond soever they
may be of the other loans, to unfancy the cane
again, and send it to Will's Coffee-House in
Scotland-yard, it being too short for any such
proper gentlemen as they are to walk with, and
too small for any of their important uses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
withal only valuable as having been the gift of a
friend."</p>

<p>As late as the year 1750 carriages were
stopped at noonday in Hyde Park, and even in
Piccadilly, and pistols presented at the breasts
of the most fashionable people. A celebrated
highwayman, by name M'Lean, was that year
taken and executed. So eager were persons of
all classes to see him that three thousand persons
visited him one day after his condemnation. The
usual reward offered by Government for the
apprehension of every highwayman was a
hundred pounds. It was not safe to venture out
after dark. Travellers were armed in broad
daylight, as though they were going to
battle.</p>

<p>In Lady Walpole's Letters I find the following
description of a very 'cute lady:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lady Browne and I were, as usual, going to
the Duchess of Montrose's at seven o'clock. The
evening was dark. In the close lane, under the
park pale, and within twenty yards of the gate,
a black figure pushed by between the chaise and
the hedge on my side. I suspected it was a
highwayman, and so, I found, did Browne, for
she was speaking, and stopped. To divert her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
fears I was going to say, 'Is not that the
apothecary going to the Duchess?' when I heard
a voice cry 'Stop!' and then the figure came
back to the chaise. I had the presence of mind
before I let down the glass, to take out my
watch and stuff it within my dress under the arm.
He said,</p>

<p>"'Your purses and watches?'</p>

<p>"'I have no watch,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'Then, your purse.'</p>

<p>"I gave it to him; it had nine guineas in it.
It was so dark that I could not see his hand,
but I felt him take it. He then asked for Lady
Browne's purse, and said,</p>

<p>"'Don't be frightened, I will not hurt
you.'</p>

<p>"'No, you won't frighten the lady,' I
said.</p>

<p>"'No, I give you my word I will not hurt you,'
he replied.</p>

<p>"Lady Browne gave him her purse, and
was going to add her watch; but he
said,</p>

<p>"'I am much obliged to you; I wish you
good night,' pulled off his hat, and rode
away.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said I, 'you will not be afraid of being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
robbed another time, for, you see, there is nothing
in it.'</p>

<p>"'Oh! but I am,' she said; 'and now I am
in terror lest he return, for I have given him
a purse with bad money in it, that I carry on
purpose.'"</p>

<p>Again we read that not only was it dangerous
to travel in bygone days from a fear of being
robbed and murdered, but the roads were so
bad that scarcely a day passed but a coach stuck
fast in the mud, and remained there until a
team of cattle could be procured from some neighbouring
farm to tug it out of the slough. On
the best lines of communication the ruts were
deep, the descents precipitous, and the road
often such that it was hardly possible to
distinguish it in the dusk from the uninclosed
heath and fen which lay on both
sides."</p>

<p>"Ralph Thoresby, the antiquary, was in danger
of losing his way on the Great North Road,
between Barnby Moor and Tuxford, and actually
lost it between Doncaster and York. Pepys and
his wife, travelling in their own coach, lost their
way between Newbury and Reading. In the
course of the same tour they lost their way near
Salisbury, and were in danger of having to pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the night on the Plain. It was only in fine
weather that the whole breadth of the road was
available for wheeled carriages. Often the mud
lay deep on the right and the left, and only a
narrow track of firm ground rose above the
quagmire. At such times obstructions and
quarrels were frequent, and the path was sometimes
blocked up during a long time by
carriers, neither of whom would break the
way.</p>

<p>"Thoresby has recorded in his diary many
perils and disasters that befell him. On one
occasion he learned that the floods were out
between Ware and London, that passengers had
to swim for their lives, and that a higgler had
perished in the attempt to cross. In consequence
of these tidings he turned out of the
high road, and was conducted across some
meadows, where it was necessary for him to ride
to the saddle skirts in water. In the course
of another journey he narrowly escaped being
swept away by an inundation of the
Trent.</p>

<p>"Of course, during the period the waters were
out coaches ceased to run. Thoresby was afterwards
detained at Stamford four days on account
of the state of the roads, and then ventured to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
proceed only because fourteen Members of the
House of Commons, who were going up in a
body to Parliament with guides and numerous
attendants, took him into their company."</p>

<p>The great route through Wales to Holyhead
was in such a state that, in 1685, Henry Hyde,
Earl of Clarendon, Viceroy, on his way to
Ireland, was five hours in travelling fourteen
miles from St. Asaph to Conway. Between Conway
and Beaumaris he was forced to walk great
part of the way, and the Countess was carried
in a litter. His coach was, with great difficulty,
and by the help of many hands, brought after
him entire. In general, carriages were taken
to pieces at Conway, and borne on the shoulders
of stout Welsh peasants to the Menai
Strait.</p>

<p>At that period, and long after, the passage
in the ferry-boat at the Menai Strait was slow
and tedious, and the packet-boat from Holyhead
to Kingstown seldom crossed over under
eight or ten hours. Now a man may, as I
did last Autumn, breakfast in London, and
sit down to a half-past seven dinner in
Dublin.</p>

<p>In Sussex the roads were so bad that when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Prince George of Denmark visited the stately
mansion of Petworth in wet weather he was
six hours in going nine miles, and it was necessary
that a body of sturdy hands should be on
each side of his coach in order to prop it. Of
the carriages which conveyed his retinue, several
were upset and injured. A letter from one
of his suite has been preserved, in which
the unfortunate gentleman-in-waiting complains
that during fourteen hours he never once alighted,
except when his coach was overturned or stuck
fast in the mud.</p>

<p>Great contrast is offered in this narrative to
the present state of travelling; "only, to be
sure," as Macaulay writes, "people did get up
again with their heads on after a roll in the
Sussex mud, which, unhappily, is not always the
case after a railway collision."</p>

<p>Arthur Young, who travelled in Lancashire
in 1770, has left us the following
account of the state of the roads at that
time.</p>

<p>"I know not," he says, "in the whole
range of language, terms sufficiently expressive
to describe this awful road. Let me most
seriously caution all travellers who may accidentally
propose to travel this terrible country to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
avoid it as they would a pestilence, for a thousand
to one they break their necks or their limbs
by overthrows or breakings down. They will
here meet with ruts which I actually measured
four feet deep, and floating with mud, only from
a wet Summer. What, therefore, must it be
after a Winter? The only mending it receives
is tumbling in some loose stones, which serve
no other purpose than jolting a carriage in the
most intolerable manner. Let me persuade
all travellers to avoid this terrible country,
which must either dislocate their bones with
broken pavement or bury them in muddy
sand."</p>

<p>In a well-known passage, Arthur Young vents
his spleen at the expense of the municipal
authorities of Lancashire, and reproachfully
reminds them that, thanks to their abominable
highways, London often suffers from want of
animal food, while country farmers are unable to
get more than five farthings a pound for good
beef!</p>

<p>A coach and six is in our time never seen,
except as part of some pageant; the frequent
mention, therefore, of such equipages in old
books is likely to mislead. We hear of private
carriages and public stage-coaches of six, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
attribute to magnificence what was really the
effect of a very disagreeable necessity. A pair
of horses now would do ten times the work six
did in the days I write of, and I cannot illustrate
this better than by giving Vanbrugh's
most humorous description of the way in which
a country gentleman, newly chosen a Member
of Parliament, came up to London. On that
occasion all the exertions of six beasts, two of
which had been taken from the plough, could
not save the family coach from being embedded
in a quagmire.</p>

<p>The scene takes place at Uncle Richard's
house in London, previous to the arrival of
his nephew, Sir Francis Headpiece, a country
gentleman and Parliament man, who was
strongly addicted to malt-liquor and field sports.
Although only forty-two years of age, it appears
that Sir Francis had drunk two-and-thirty
tuns of ale, while in the pursuit of the chase
he had broken his right arm, his left leg, and
both his collar-bones.</p>

<p>Uncle Richard had just read his wiseacre
nephew's letter, when James, the footman,
enters hastily.</p>

<p>"Sir, Sir," he exclaims, "they're all
a-coming; here's John Moody arrived already.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
He's stamping about the streets in his dirty
boots, asking every man he meets if they can
tell where he may have a good lodging for a
Parliament man, till he can hire such a house
as becomes him. He tells them his lady and
all the family are coming too, and that they
are so nobly attended they care not a fig for
anybody. Sir, they have added two cart-horses
to the four old bays, because my Lady will
have it said she came to town in her coach-and-six;
and, ha, ha! heavy George, the
ploughman, rides postilion."</p>

<p>"Very well, James," responds his master,
"the journey begins as it should do. Dost
know whether they bring all the children with
them?"</p>

<p>"Only Squire Humphrey and Miss Betty,
Sir; the other six are put to board, at half-a-crown
a week a head, with Joan Grouse, at
Smokedunghill Farm."</p>

<p>"Dost know when they'll be here?"</p>

<p>"Sir, they'd have been here last night, but
that the old wheezy horse tired, and the two
fore wheels came crash down at once in Waggonrut
Lane. Sir, they were cruelly loaden,
as I understand. My Lady herself, he says,
laid on four mail-trunks, besides the great deal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
box which fat Tom and the monkey sat upon
behind."</p>

<p>"So."</p>

<p>"Then within the coach there was Sir Francis,
my Lady, the great fat lap-dog, Squire Humphrey,
Miss Betty, my Lady's maid, Mrs.
Handy, and Dolly the cook; but she was so
ill with sitting backward that they mounted her
into the coachbox."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, for fear of a famine before they
could get to the baiting-place, there were such
baskets of plum-cake, Dutch gingerbread,
Cheshire cheese, Naples biscuits, macaroons,
neats' tongues, and cold boiled beef&mdash;and in
case of sickness, such bottles of usquebagh,
black cherry brandy, cinnamon-water, sack,
tent, and strong beer, as made the old coach
crack again; and for defence of this good cheer
and my Lady's little pearl necklace, there was
the family basket-hilt sword, the great Turkish
scimitar, the old blunderbuss, a good bag of
bullets, and a great horn of gunpowder."</p>

<p>"Admirable."</p>

<p>"Then for band-boxes, they were so bepiled
up to Sir Francis's nose that he could only
peep out at a chance hole with one eye, as if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
were viewing the country through a perspective-glass."</p>

<p>Sir John Vanbrugh, who wrote the above
admirable account of a journey to London, was
the grandson of a Protestant refugee from the
Netherlands, and the son of a wealthy sugar-baker.
Little is known of the history of his
youth, or of that training which enabled him not
only to become one of the most celebrated
English architects, but also, in conjunction with
Congreve, to produce some excellent comedies.
As an architect, he designed Castle Howard and
Blenheim; as a dramatist, his most successful
plays were "The Relapse" and "The Provoked
Wife," and the uncompleted "Journey to London,"
which was worked up by Colley Cibber
into "The Provoked Husband."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"The good of ancient times let others state;</div>
<div class="line i0h">I think it lucky I was born so late."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So wrote Sydney Smith, and it is a sentiment
that all must concur in. The witty divine goes
on to state:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A young man alive at this period hardly
knows to what improvement of human life he
has been introduced, and I would bring before
his notice the following changes which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
taken place in England since I first began to
breathe in it the breath of life&mdash;a period amounting
now to nearly seventy-three years. Gas
was unknown. I groped about the streets of
London in all but the utter darkness of a twinkling
oil lamp, under the protection of watchmen
in their grand climacteric, and exposed to every
species of depredation and insult. I have been
nine hours sailing from Dover to Calais before
the invention of steam. It took me nine hours
to go from Taunton to Bath before the invention
of railroads, and I now go in six hours from
London to Bath."</p>

<p>The witty Reverend then proceeds to refer
to wooden pavements instead of stone ones,
the new police instead of the superannuated
"Charleys," the well-appointed cab (what would
he have said to the hansom)? in lieu of the
lumbering hackney coach, waterproof instead
of primitive pulp hats; he then calls the attention
of the reader to the introduction of gentlemen's
braces, colchicum, calomel, and clubs.
He might have added, the greatest boons of
all, the telegraph, which "wafts a sigh from
Indus to the Pole," or, unpoetically speaking,
announces in an incredibly short space of time
the arrival of a friend in India or America, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
would he have omitted chloroform, which saves
hours of agony and torture, and which is an
especial blessing to the humbler classes, who,
when undergoing some painful operation, have
not the comforts of the wealthier class about
them.</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p>The term "slow coach" became proverbial,
and was applied not only to the lumbering
six-inside vehicles that travelled at almost a
snail's pace, but to every schoolboy and collegian
who possessed little or no gumption. Unfortunately,
in those days the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals did not exist,
or many a hulking fellow would have been had
up for his merciless use of the lash when urging
his wretched cattle up a severe hill or over ruts
recently laid down with large unbroken stones&mdash;smooth
"macadamised" roads being not then
in prospective existence. So heavy was the
draught that an appeal was being constantly
made to the passengers to alight and walk
up any acclivity, which upon a wet day or when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the mud was ankle-deep, was not a very pleasant
thing.</p>

<p>Such was the system of travelling in the good
old times, as they were called, when every
affair of life moved on at a quiet, jog-trot
pace. But when competition of the most eager
kind became the order of the day, it cannot be
said that mails or coaches stood still. The
Edinburgh Mail ran four hundred miles in forty
hours, stoppages included. The Exeter day
coach, the "Herald," went over its ground, one
hundred and seventy-three miles, in twenty hours,
an admirable performance, considering the
natural unevenness of the country; and the
Devonport Mail performed the journey, two
hundred and twenty-seven miles, in twenty-two
hours. The increase of speed was alarming to
those who had been accustomed to the old-fashioned
slow coaches, and the rate at which
the new vehicles travelled was considered reckless
risking of human life.</p>

<p>It may not be here out of place to observe
that the first requisite in a coach horse is action,
and the second sound legs and feet, with blood
and bone. The third desideratum is good wind,
as the power of respiration is called, without
which the first and second qualifications avail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
but little for any length of time. A clear-winded
coach horse will always keep his condition, and
consequently his health, because he does not
feel distress on a reasonable length of ground.
The hunter or racer is good or bad, chiefly in
proportion to his powers of respiration, and such
equally applies to the coach horse. The food
most proper, then, for a coach horse in fast
work is that which affords ample support, without
having a pernicious influence on his wind;
or to use a more elegant, though not more
forcible, expression, that which does not
impair his respiratory organs by pressing on
them.</p>

<p>To return to the fast coaches, so splendidly
were they horsed, and so admirably well did
they keep their time, that they fully merited the
following eulogium.</p>

<p>At a dinner given at Shrewsbury some
five and thirty years ago by coachmen
and guards to the Honourable Mr. Kenyon,
that gentleman, in proposing the health of
Mr. R. Taylor, coach proprietor, made some
interesting statements on the subject of stage-coach
travelling. Among other remarks, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As a coach proprietor, Mr. Taylor was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
of the most spirited in England. He had, at
one time, two of the very best coaches that
ever ran&mdash;the "Hirondelle" and "Wonder."
No coach established for itself a higher
reputation than the former. On May 1st,
(the precise year he could not recollect) it
accomplished its journey of one hundred and
twenty miles in eight hours and twenty
minutes&mdash;a speed few coaches could ever boast
of.</p>

<p>"He (Mr. Kenyon) was in Shrewsbury that
day, and saw a team of four greys, belonging
to Mr. Taylor, enter the town, which had done
their nine miles in thirty-five minutes. He
recollected that there were two ladies inside the
coach, who were informed that, as that day
was appointed for a trial of strength, they might,
if they were frightened at the speed, choose any
other conveyance they pleased, and should be
forwarded on their journey immediately; but
their answer showed good blood; they said they
were not aware that they had come at the great
speed they had, and that they preferred going
fast.</p>

<p>"With regard to the 'Wonder,' he himself
left the 'Lion Yard,' Shrewsbury, one morning
at six o'clock, and was at Islington the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
evening at seven o'clock, being only thirteen
hours on the road. On that occasion he was
driven by four of the best coachmen he ever
saw.</p>

<p>"Another instance of the reputation the
'Wonder' had acquired was given him by his
friend Sir Henry Peyton, who had informed him
that he had frequently seen persons at St. Albans
regulating their watches by the 'Wonder' coach
as it came into that town. This was the only
instance he had ever heard of a coach regulating
the time. It was clear that the coach
could not have gained such a name for regularity
without good cattle and good coachmen, and
it was to the proprietors they were indebted."</p>

<p>Charles Holmes, the driver of the "Blenheim"
coach was in the year 1835 presented with
a silver cup bearing the following inscription,</p>

<p>/#
"Presented to Charles Holmes by Sir Henry
Peyton on behalf of himself and two hundred and
fifty subscribers, in testimony of their admiration
of his good conduct as driver of the 'Blenheim'
coach for a period of upwards of twenty
years."
#/</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
The subscription was limited to ten shillings,
the actual half sovereign subscribed by the late
Duke of Wellington was let into the bottom of
the vase. The cup was presented to this first-rate
"dragsman" after a dinner at the
"Thatched House," presided over by Sir Henry
Peyton.</p>

<p>Among the numerous anecdotes the road
have furnished, perhaps one of the most
amusing ones is the story of the Oxford "Defiance."</p>

<p>Term was over; the coach was full of
young Oxonians returning to their respective
colleges; the morning was cold, wet, and
miserable, when the well-appointed "drag"
drove up to the "White Horse Cellar," Piccadilly.</p>

<p>"Have you room for one inside?" asked as
pretty a girl as you would wish to see on a
Summer's day.</p>

<p>"What a beauty!" exclaimed one.</p>

<p>"Quite lovely!" said another.</p>

<p>"Perfect!" lisped a third.</p>

<p>"Quite full, Miss, inside and out," replied the
coachman.</p>

<p>"Surely you could make room for one," persevered
the fair applicant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
"Quite impossible, without the young gentlemen's
consent."</p>

<p>"Lots of room," cried the insides; "we are
not very large; we can manage to take one
more."</p>

<p>"If the gentlemen consent," replied the
driver, "I can have no objection."</p>

<p>"We agree," said the inside quartette.</p>

<p>"All right," responded the coachman.</p>

<p>The fare was paid, and the guard proceeded
to open the door, and let down the
steps.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss, if you please; we are behind our
time."</p>

<p>"Come along, grandfather," cried the damsel,
addressing a most respectable-looking,
portly, elderly man; "the money is paid;
get in, and be sure you thank the young
gentlemen," at the same time suiting the
action to the word, and, with a smile, assisting
her respected grandfather into the
coach.</p>

<p>"Here's some mistake. You'll squeeze us
to death," cried the astonished party.</p>

<p>"Sorry to incommode you," replied the intruder;
"I hope you won't object to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
both windows up, I'm sadly troubled with a
cough."</p>

<p>At this moment, "All right, sit fast!" was
heard; and the "Defiance" rattled away, best
pace, drowning the voices of the astonished
Oxonians.</p>

<p>"Nimrod" tells a good story of the Shrewsbury
and Chester "Highflyer," which started
at eight o'clock in the morning and arrived
at Chester about the same time in the evening&mdash;distance
forty miles. This was always
a good hard road for wheels, and rather
favourable for draught; and how, then, could
all these hours be accounted for?</p>

<p>"Why, if a commercial gentleman had a
little business at Ellesmere there was plenty of
time for that. If a real gentleman wanted to
pay a morning visit on the road, there could
be no objection to that. In the pork-pie season
half an hour was generally occupied in consuming
one of them, for Mr. Williams, the coachman,
was a wonderful favourite with the
farmers' wives and daughters all along the
road.</p>

<p>"The coach dined at Wrexham, and Wrexham
Church was to be seen&mdash;a fine specimen
of the florid Gothic, and one of the wonders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of Wales. Then Wrexham was also famous for
ale, there being no public breweries in those
days in Wales; and, above all, the inn belonged
to Sir Watkin. About two hours were allowed
for dinner, but Billy Williams, one of the
best-tempered fellows on earth, as honest as
Aristides, was never particular to half an hour
or so.</p>

<p>"'The coach is ready, gentlemen,' he would
say; 'but don't let me disturb you if you wish
for another bottle.'"</p>

<p>What a contrast does this furnish to the
hasty meals at the railway stations, where the
bell for departure is heard long before the
hungry passenger has swallowed half his
scalding soup, or devoured his plate of cold
meat!</p>

<p>The removal of posting and coaching from
the road has had a baneful effect upon every
branch of trade and industry. One example
from each line of railway will show the
consequences of the change that has taken
place.</p>

<p>In the town of Hounslow, which was the
first stage on the Great Western Road, there
used to be kept, for the purposes of coaching
and posting, two thousand five hundred horses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Any person acquainted with the nature of the
business is aware that it would not be by any
means an exaggeration to say that every one
of these horses, for keep, duty, shoeing, ostlers,
harness, &amp;c., occasioned an outlay of two
pounds per week, so that there was a sum of
five thousand pounds circulated every week in
this one town, besides the money that was
spent by travellers at the different inns; and
a very considerable portion of that amount was
paid for labour and distributed among the different
tradesmen, every one of whom was benefited
directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>The state of things on the first stage of
the Western Road will serve as an example for
the whole of the remaining distance, as, of
course, an equal number of horses was required
all the way down the road, and the effect,
therefore, was equally destructive upon all
towns which were formerly thriving and prosperous&mdash;witness
Reading, Newbury, Hungerford,
Marlborough.</p>

<p>On the Northern Road an equally disastrous
effect has been produced. At Barnet, where
formerly Messrs. Bryant and Newman, the rival
postmasters, could produce three hundred to
four hundred pairs of horses, and where, also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
an immense number of coach-horses were kept,
the grass has grown over the inn yard. The
same observation applies with equal force
to all towns east and south of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The above gave rise to the following parody
on Goldsmith's "Deserted Village":&mdash;</p>

<p>A popular writer who flourished some five
and forty years ago quotes a letter from a personal
friend, who boasts of the following wonderful
feat of locomotion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was out hunting last season, on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Monday, near Brighton, and dined with my
father in Merrion Square, Dublin, at six o'clock
on the following Wednesday, distance four hundred
miles."</p>

<p>It was done thus:&mdash;He went from Brighton
in an afternoon coach that set him down in
London in time for the Holyhead Mail, and
this mail, with the help of the steamer to cross
the Channel, delivered him in Dublin at the
time mentioned.</p>

<p>What would the writer say now, when, by
leaving London at 7.15 a.m., he may dine at
the table-d'hôte at the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin,
at 7.30 p.m., with ample time to have a
hot bath and change his dress before dinner
is served?</p>

<p>The writer then proceeds to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In this wonder-working age few greater
improvements have been made in any of the
useful arts than in those applied to the system
of travelling by land. Projectors and projects
have multiplied with our years, and the fairy-petted
princes of the "Arabian Nights' Entertainments"
were scarcely transported from
place to place with more facility or dispatch
than Englishmen are in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1832. From
Liverpool to Manchester, thirty-six miles, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
an hour and a half! Surely Dædalus is come
amongst us again."</p>

<p>What would the writer of the above have
thought if he had lived to travel by what is
termed the "Flying Dutchman," which now
runs from London to Plymouth in six hours
and a quarter, and which, we understand,
will shortly accomplish seventy miles an
hour.</p>

<p>To resume&mdash;or, as the gentlemanly gang
under Captain Macheath say, "Let us take
the road" as it was at the period above mentioned.</p>

<p>The Edinburgh Mail ran the distance (four
hundred miles) in forty hours, stoppages included.
The Exeter day-coach, the "Herald,"
performed her journey of one hundred and
seventy-three miles in twenty hours; Stevenson's
Brighton "Age" kept its time to the
minute; in short, from London to Cheltenham,
Gloucester, Worcester, Birmingham, Norwich,
Bath, Bristol, Southampton, Oxford, Cambridge,
was little more than a pleasant Summer
day's drive.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish the above fast journey
two important considerations were required;
first, that the horses should not be overworked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
and, secondly, that they should be well fed.
Horses have increased greatly in price since
the period I write of, and a team which would
have cost a hundred guineas in 1832 could not
now be had for two hundred and fifty guineas.
The cost of coaches of the best materials
varied from one hundred and forty pounds to
one hundred and sixty pounds; generally speaking,
they were hired from the maker at from
twopence half-penny to threepence per mile.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="hanging indent">JOURNEY TO BATH IN THE PALMY DAYS OF COACHING&mdash;A
DRIVING GIOVANNI&mdash;"PARSON DENNIS"&mdash;CONTRAST TO THE
ABOVE&mdash;TENNANT'S DESCRIPTION&mdash;THE OLD BRIGHTON
ROAD&mdash;MODERN IMPROVEMENTS&mdash;A SQUIRE OF 1638.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>I now proceed to describe the road as it was
before panting steeds had givin way to
puffing engines, iron greys to iron rails, coachmen
and guards to stokers, and horseflesh to
steam, which has been likened to water in a
high state of perspiration.</p>

<p>It was early in a morning, in the merry
month of May, when I found myself at the
"White Horse Cellar," Piccadilly, just as the
York House coach was starting for Bath. I
had previously secured the box seat, and, encased
in a double-breasted drab coat, waited the arrival
of a noble Duke, then a Marquis, well known
to all the best coachmen on the road as a
most liberal patron, and a first-rate whip himself.</p>

<p>"Sorry to have kept you," said the newcomer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
"but Swaine only sent home the whip
I promised you this morning; you will find it
in this narrow deal case."</p>

<p>"Allow me to give up my place to you," I
said, addressing the Marquis.</p>

<p>"Thank you a thousand times," he replied,
"I am unfortunately engaged. We are going
to man my new cutter, and pull to the Red
House and back."</p>

<p>The case was handed up; the dragsman expressed
his thanks.</p>

<p>"All right behind, gentlemen," he thundered,
fingering the ribbons in the plenitude of vehicular
importance. Away we went, rattling
along the stony pavement of Piccadilly at an
awful rate to make up for the lost time.</p>

<p>"Nice morning, Sir," said my companion,
as we passed through the turnpike-gate that
then stood opposite the entrance to the Park,
near Apsley House. "The flowers are all
a-blowing and a-growing." This line he sang,
and then continued, "My missus gave me these
beautiful violets about an hour ago."</p>

<p>"'Sam,' said she, 'I know I can trust you
not to give them away to any girls on the
road.'"</p>

<p>I turned round to admire the bouquet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
take a look at the wearer, who fully realised
the description of the swell-dragsman immortalised
in song by the late Hon. Fitzroy Stanhope.
He was a well-dressed, natty-looking
fellow, decked out in a neat dark brown coat,
white hat, corduroy breeches, well polished
boots, cloth leggings, and a splendid pair of
double-sewn buckskin gloves. A huge pair of
whiskers, shaped like a mutton chop, fringed
the borders of each cheek, and were (as a
costermonger in Knightsbridge irreverently remarked)
large enough to pad a cart-saddle. In
the course of conversation he invariably indulged
the outside passengers with snatches of the
popular ditties of the day, "Oh, say not woman's
heart is bought," "Love has Eyes," "Will
you come to the bower?" "Savourneen Deelish,"
"The Thorn," and "Sally in our
Alley."</p>

<p>I soon discovered, from his manners and
remarks, that my new coaching ally was a prodigious
favourite with the fair sex, and from
the roguish leer that he gave the respective
damsels at the different inns and public-houses,
I fancied he did not quite merit the confidence
his wife placed in him. Indeed, when we
stopped to change horses at Slough, I saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
faithless Lothario present the pretty barmaid of
the "Red Lion" with the bunch of violets, which
she placed near her heart. Nay, more, if my
optics did not deceive me, he implanted a kiss
on the rosy lips of the blooming landlady, who
faintly exclaimed, "For shame, you naughty
man."</p>

<p>As I had won the good graces of this driving
Giovanni, not only by listening to the story of his
conquests over the rural Hebes, who dispensed
their smiles and liquor to him, but by commending
his voice in "Pray, Goody," which I declared
to be equal to Sinclair's, he offered me the reins
just after passing the "Sun Inn" at Maidenhead.</p>

<p>"Take 'em gently up the hill," said he,
"and then you can have a spirt over the
thicket."</p>

<p>To say that I was proud is to say nothing,
for, having passed a few months with a private
tutor at Littlewick Green, within two miles of
the spot where we were, I felt that I should
cut no little figure as I drove by the "Coach
and Horses," a wayside public-house where I
and my companions used to keep our guns when
at our tutor's.</p>

<p>"Do you pull up at the 'Coach and Horses?'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
I inquired, in so nervous a manner&mdash;I was then
young, and, as Shakespeare writes, "in my
salad days"&mdash;that the coachman, who is what is
termed "wide-awake" upon all affairs of the
heart, guessed my motive.</p>

<p>"We can, Sir, if you like," he responded.
"Perhaps Dick has a parcel to leave for Squire
Lee. Anything for the thicket?" he continued,
turning to the "shooter" behind, and giving
him a knowing wink, a hint which the other
took at once.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Sam; I wish to know whether
Mr. Vansittart has sent for the empty sack I
left there last Monday."</p>

<p>As we reached the well-known spot where I
had passed many a half-hour in the society of
the pretty, innocent girl whose fair face, blue
eyes, auburn ringlets, and bewitching smile had
turned the heads of all the youths in the neighbourhood,
my heart began to palpitate, my
hands to tremble, and I should have driven past
the house had not my box companion caught
hold of the reins with a firm grasp and pulled
the horses up in front of the public-house.
Fortunately, my Dulcinea had not noticed the
hand that assisted me, and, seeing the coach
stop, rushed to the door, exclaiming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
"Lord William! Who would have thought it!
How much you have improved in driving! Do
you recollect when you upset the dog-cart close
to that pond?"</p>

<p>"I hope your father is well," I replied,
anxious to change the conversation; "and Sally&mdash;I
mean Miss Sadbroke&mdash;let the coachman
and guard have a glass of your cream of the
valley."</p>

<p>"Pray alight, my Lord," said the coachman,
"I was not aware who I had the honour of
addressing. Dick, show his Lordship into the
bar."</p>

<p>I jumped down, rushed into the well-known
snuggery, shook hands with poor old Sadgrove,
who was a victim to what he called the
"rheumatiz," quaffed a glass of bright, sparkling
ale, threw down a crown piece, kissed my
hand to the blooming girl, and mounted the
box, not a little elated with my adventure.
But to quit this spot of juvenile reminiscences.
We trotted past my tutor's house on the green,
where I was cheered by the boys of the village
school, and, after an agreeable drive, reached
Reading and then Newbury. Here the passengers
were allowed twenty minutes for dinner,
where we (I can answer for myself) did ample
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
justice to the fare, which consisted of a splendid
boiled leg of mutton and a ham-and-veal
pie.</p>

<p>"I go no further, gentlemen," said the
coachman.</p>

<p>"All right," I responded, handing him a gold
seven-shilling piece, then a current coin of the
realm.</p>

<p>"Good morning! and thank you, my Lord,"
replied the deposed monarch of the whip. "I've
told Mr. Dennis (commonly called Parson
Dennis) that your Lordship has your driving-gloves
on."</p>

<p>Again mounting the box, I found myself
seated by one of the smartest men I ever met
with at that period on the road. There was an
air of conceit about him that was truly amusing,
and it was rendered doubly so by his affected
style of conversation. Unlike other dragsmen,
he was dressed in the plainest style imaginable&mdash;a
well-brushed black beaver hat, glossier than
silk; a brown cutaway coat, dark Oxford mixed
overalls, highly-polished Wellington boots, and
fawn-coloured double kid gloves. The first
object of my new companion was to inform me
that he was well born, that he had been educated
at Oxford, and that he was the most popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
man at Bath; indeed, so much so that he was
called the Beau Nash of the road. Unquestionably,
according to his own showing, he was
entitled to that distinction, for he offered to
point out all the sights of the English Montpellier,
including the assemblies, theatre, pump-room,
crescents, gardens, walks, and abbey. So
delighted was I with the dandified manner of
my companion that the journey passed rapidly
away.</p>

<p>On leaving Marlborough, he offered me the
reins, which I accepted; and during the last
stage he begged I would accept a pinch of the
best Petersham mixture, informing me that it
was a present from the noble Lord of that name,
to whom he had been presented by an old
Oxford acquaintance. Upon reaching the city
of Bladud and driving up to the "York House,"
Mr. Dennis, with the air of Louis le Grand,
politely took off his hat, wished me good evening,
thanked me for my gratuity, and
said that if I mentioned his name at
the hotel every attention would be paid to
me.</p>

<p>As a contrast to the above, let me show how
our great-grandfathers travelled in 1739. Tennant
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
"In March I changed my Welsh school for
one nearer to the capital, and travelled in the
Chester stage, then no despicable vehicle for
country gentlemen. The first day, with much
labour, we got from Chester to Whitchurch,
twenty miles; the second day to the "Welsh
Harp," the third to Coventry, the fourth to
Northampton, the fifth to Dunstable; and, as a
wondrous effort, on the last to London before
the commencement of the night. The strain
and labour of six horses, sometimes eight, drew
us through the slough of Mireden and many
other places. We were constantly out two hours
before day, and as late at night, and in the depth
of Winter proportionately later. Families who
travelled in their own carriages contracted with
Benson and Co., and were dragged up in the same
number of days."</p>

<p>The single gentlemen&mdash;then a hardy race&mdash;equipped
in jack-boots, rode post, through almost
impassable roads, guarded against the mire, defying
the frequent stumbles and falls, pursuing
their journey with alacrity, while in these our
days their enervated posterity sleep away their
rapid journeys in easy railway carriages, fitted
for the soft inhabitants of Sybaris. I can vouch
for the latter, for I left York a few weeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
ago at night, after delivering a lecture of
an hour and a quarter, and was in bed
in Hans Place by four o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>In bygone days a journey to Brighton occupied
one entire day. Latterly the march
of improvement has made rapid strides upon
all roads. Brighton can now be reached
in an hour and thirteen minutes; first class
fares, by express (which are about to be
reduced), thirteen shillings and threepence; by
ordinary trains, ten shillings; second class
express, ten shillings; ordinary trains, seven
shillings and ninepence; third class, four shillings
and sixpence. An inside passenger by the old
coach had to pay sixteen shillings to Brighton;
and for excess of luggage, if he carried what is
now allowed to a first class passenger, a further
charge of eight shillings and fourpence would be
made; total, one pound four shillings and fourpence.</p>

<p>"This is the patent age of inventions." So
wrote Byron, more than sixty years ago. Had
he lived in our time how much greater cause
would he have had to make the remark; for
since the days of the noble poet how many inventions
have been introduced! Steamboats and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
railways instead of canvas sails and horses;
active, wide-awake policemen instead of superannuated,
sleeping "Charlies" of the Dogberry
school; brilliant gas in lieu of the darkness-made-visible
light, "whose oily rays shot from the
crystal lamp."</p>

<p>No longer can we hail the "officious link-boy's
smoky light," except during a dense thick, pea-soup
coloured fog in the suicidal month of
November. Instead of paved streets we have
macadamised roads, albeit, there are some wiseacres
who are (to adopt the old joke) <i>putting
their heads together</i> to form a wooden pavement.
We have light broughams and neat cabs
instead of the rattling "agony" or hackney
coach; iron vessels have taken the place of the
"wooden walls of Old England," though our
gallant tars are still "hearts of oak;" light
French wines have driven good old humble port
from our cellars, much to the advantage of gouty
subjects.</p>

<p>Last, not least, the improved system of locomotion
enables the sportsman to hunt from
London, to enjoy his breakfast and return to his
dinner in the metropolis, to run down to Ascot,
Epsom, Egham, Brighton, Croydon, Sandown
Park, Windsor, and Goodwood races, and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
back at night, while the follower of old Isaac
Walton may kill his trout in some of the Berkshire
or Hampshire streams and enjoy the pleasure
of his (the fish's) company at a seven o'clock
dinner in London.</p>

<p>Of course, occasionally there are discomforts
connected with the rail, for on a fine Summer's
day it is far more agreeable to view the country
from a travelling chariot, britchka, or stage-coach,
than to be shot forth like an arrow from
a crossbow, at an awful rate, amidst a hissing,
whizzing, ear-piercing, shrill, sharp noise, something
between a catcall in the gallery of some
transpontine theatre on Boxing Night and the
war-whoop of the Ojibbeway Indians after a
scalping-party in North America. Then the
odour! Instead of the scent of the brier, the
balmy bean-field, the cottage-side honeysuckle,
the jessamine, you have an essence of villanous
compounds&mdash;sulphur, rank oil, and
soot.</p>

<p>Again, the railway traveller occasionally finds
his luggage missing; sometimes it is lost; our
only wonder is that the above does not happen
more frequently when we find the platform filled
with loungers of all classes. Whether there are
more fatal accidents by rail (in proportion to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
excess of travellers) over those who formerly
journeyed by road we know not for certain,
but we are disposed to think there are
not.</p>

<p>Therefore, to sum up, if the question was
"Road <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</i> Rail," taking all the pros and cons
into consideration, we should give the verdict for
the defendant.</p>

<p>The modern lover of field sports is no longer
a drunken, rollicking, two or four-bottle man;
he prefers the society of the ladies in the
drawing-room to that of the half-inebriated
gentlemen in the dining-room; he dresses in a
becoming manner, seldom swears, and, as far as
his means go, keeps open house. What a contrast
is this to the sportsman of bygone days!
Perhaps, however, the following is the most
curious picture of the sporting life and rude
habits of the English country gentleman of the
olden time, extant.</p>

<p>"In the year 1638 lived Mr. Hastings, second
son of an Earl of Huntingdon. He was, peradventure,
an original in our age, or rather the
copy of our ancient nobility in hunting, not in
warlike times. He was low, very strong, and
very active, of a reddish flaxen hair. His
clothes, always green cloth, and never all worth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
(when new) five pounds; his house was perfectly
of the old fashion, in the midst of a large
park, well stocked with deer, and near the
house rabbits, to serve his kitchen; many fishponds,
great store of wood and timber, a
bowling green in it (long, but narrow), full of
high ridges, it being never levelled since it was
ploughed. They used round lead bowls, and
it had a banqueting house, like a stand, built in
a tree.</p>

<p>"He kept all manner of sport-hounds, that
ran buck, fox, hare, otter, and badger; and
hawks, long and short-winged. He had all
sorts of nets for fish; he had a walk in
the New Forest and the Manor of Christ
Church.</p>

<p>"This last supplied him with red deer, sea
and river fish; and, indeed, all his neighbours
grounds and royalties were free to him, who
bestowed all his time on these sports. He was
popular with his neighbours, and was ever a
welcome guest at their houses; he, too, kept
open house, where beef, pudding, and small
beer, were to be had in plenty; his great hall
was full of marrow bones, and full of hawks'
perches, hounds, spaniels, and terriers, the
upper side of which was hung with foxes'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
brushes, here and there a polecat intermixed.</p>

<p>"The parlour was a very large room, and
properly furnished. On a great hearth, paved
with brick, lay some terriers, and the choicest
hounds and spaniels. Seldom but two of the
great chairs had litters of young cats in them,
which were not to be disturbed, he having
always three or four attending him at dinner,
and a little white round stick of fourteen inches
lying by his trencher, that he might defend such
meat as he had no mind to part with to
them.</p>

<p>"The windows (which were very large) served
for places to lay his arrows, crossbows, stonebows,
and other such-like accoutrements. The
corners of the room full of the best chase
hunting and hawking poles, an oyster-table at
the lower end, which was of constant use twice
a day all the year round, for he never failed to
eat oysters before dinner and supper through
all seasons; the neighbouring town of Poole
supplied him with them. The upper part of
the room had two small tables and a desk, on
the one side of which was a Church Bible, and
on the other the 'Book of Martyrs.'</p>

<p>"On the tables were hawks' hoods, bells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
and such like, two or three old green hats,
with their crowns thrust in, so as to hold ten
or a dozen eggs, which were of a pheasant kind
of poultry he took much care of, and fed himself.
Tables, dice, cards, and bowls were
not wanting. In the hole of the desk were
scores of tobacco-pipes that had been
used.</p>

<p>"On one side of this end of the room was
the door of a closet, wherein stood the strong
beer and the wine, which never came thence
but in single glasses, that being the rule of
the house strictly observed, for he never exceeded
in drink or permitted it. On the other
side was the door into an old chapel, not used
for devotion; the pulpit, as the safest place,
was never wanting of a cold chine of beef,
venison pasty, gammon of bacon, or great
apple-pie, with thick crust, extremely baked.</p>

<p>"His table cost him not much, though it
was good to eat at; his sports supplied all but
beef and mutton, except Fridays, when he had
the best salt fish (as well as other fish) he
could get, and that was the day his neighbours
of best quality most visited him. He
never wanted a London Pudding, and always
sang it in with 'My past lies therein&mdash;a.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
"He drank a glass of wine or two at meals,
very often syrup of gilliflower in his sack, and
had always a tun glass without feet by his side,
holding a pint of small beer, which he often
stirred with rosemary. He was well natured,
but soon angry; he lived to be a hundred;
never lost his eye-sight, but always read and
wrote without spectacles, and got on horseback
without help. Until past fourscore he
rode to the death of a stag as well as
any."</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER V.</p>

<p>"Every medal has its reverse." Many persons
may be found who denounce coaching
as an abomination; while others declare
that railway travelling is most fatal only not
to the lives, but to the comforts of Her Majesty's
subjects. I pass over the dangers of the rail,
and will lay before my readers the opinions
expressed by the two contending parties. One
declares that, among the many improvements of
which this age has been productive&mdash;and many
and vast have they been&mdash;that of travelling
unquestionably bears the bell. The very word,
however, has now become a misnomer. It is
no longer travelling; it is flying over the country,
luxuriously and triumphantly, at a pace
that equals the hurricane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
The rapidity with which travellers are now
conveyed by steam over the length and breadth
of the country is a social advantage which,
for manifold purposes, cannot be too much appreciated.
Some may remember, and have not
those suffered from, the old slow and sure
system?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"This racks the joints,</div>
<div class="line i0h">This fires the veins,</div>
<div class="line i0h">That every labouring sinew strains,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>might have been the motto of those stage-coaches
which in former days pursued their
way at the rate of six miles an hour, to the
misery, inconvenience, and detention of every
passenger that was doomed to the adoption of
such conveyances. The pillory would now be
preferable to the top of a stage-coach on its
passage from London to Exeter on a dark, tempestuous
night in December. What inexpressible
horrors does the very idea suggest!</p>

<p>The expense, too, was no trifling consideration;
for after the fare was paid, half of which was
recouped if you did not put in an appearance,
fees were incessantly demanded and wrung
from the luckless traveller, as if he were a sheep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
born to be fleeced by a pack of merciless
hirelings.</p>

<p>Ere you started on your journey, a porter
rushed up, and, whether permitted or not, seized
your carpet-bag or hat-box, and pitching them
into the boot, regardless of their contents,
would turn round and, with audacious effrontery,
demand a fee for his trouble; ay,
and if he did not get it would abuse you
roundly to your face. Then, the dignity of
the box-seat! "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nota quæ sedes fuerat columbis</i>"&mdash;pigeons
they were, with a vengeance, that
occupied it. At what price was it purchased!
Entailing a double fee&mdash;one to the porter for
casting your coat upon it, the other to the
coachman for the privilege of sitting with your
teeth in the wind, sharing his conversation, his
rug, and his seat.</p>

<p>Talk not of the spicy team, the rattling
bars, which for short journeys in fine weather
was an agreeable way of travelling; but for
distances the inside of a coach was almost
insupportable. Outside in Winter not much
better.</p>

<p>Then, again, the great improvement in
travelling since the road gave way to the rail is
never more deeply felt and rejoiced at than at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Easter, Whitsuntide, and the festive season of
Christmas, as it enables so many more to visit
their friends in the country than was formerly
the case, with a greater amount, too, of comfort
to themselves, and at a considerably less
expense.</p>

<p>In the old days of coaching and posting few,
comparatively speaking, would be conveyed to
or from the metropolis. Those who travelled
post were often detained for horses; and those
who went by coach had to book their places
weeks before, paying half the fare, and even then
a heavy fall of snow might put an end to all
journeys. Now, instead of sitting for hours wet
through from the pelting pitiless storm outside a
coach&mdash;instead of being called by candlelight,
and traversing the streets in a slow rumbling
vehicle, the traveller can enjoy his breakfast in
London, can be conveyed to the station in a
fast-trotting hansom, can sit snugly protected
from the weather, and reach his destination in a
fourth of the time his predecessors could on the
road.</p>

<p>And here it may not be out of place to describe
a journey by coach, say from London to Bath,
on a cold raw Winter's day. I speak of the time
when the old, crawling, creaking, rattling, six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
inside vehicle had not given way to the fast four-horse
light coach.</p>

<p>Often have I travelled by one of these wretched
conveyances to Newbury, when I was at a
private tutor's at Donnington Grove. As
lucifer-matches had not then been introduced,
the only method of getting a light was by
striking a flint against a steel in a tinder-box.
Your candle lit, a hasty toilet made, you descended,
if at an hotel, into a coffee-room,
miserably lit, and reeking with the odour of gin,
brandy, and punch.</p>

<p>At that early hour, breakfast was out of the
question. Then there was the uncertainty
whether the hackney-coach you had ordered
over night would be forthcoming; if it did arrive,
you reached the "White Horse Cellar" or "Gloucester"
Coffee-House by a little before six, where
a glass of rum and milk, or some "early purl,"
might be had. If an inside passenger, you were
subjected to being "cribb'd, cabin'd, confined"
in a small compass, without head or knee room,
for nearly sixteen hours. If an outsider, there
was the discomfort of cold winds, drifting
snow, heavy rain, and dripping umbrellas.</p>

<p>Then the dinners on the road&mdash;twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
minutes allowed, with its scalding soup stained
warm water, its tough steaks, its Scotch collops,
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liquidis profusus odoribus</i>," its underdone boiled
leg of mutton, its potatoes, hot without and
hard within. Then the scramble for a nook by
the fire to dry the soaked coat, cloak, or hat;
then the change of coachmen, all of whom expected
to be remembered; then the fees to
guard and porters. Let anyone picture to
himself or herself the miseries of such a
journey, and be thankful that they have all
nearly vanished under the mighty power of
steam.</p>

<p>Having given the opinions of the advocates of
the rail, I turn to those of the road, who thus
describe the delights of a journey in a fast
coach.</p>

<p>They suppose a fine Spring morning, when you
find yourself seated by the side of a pleasant
companion, behind four blood horses, the roads
sufficiently watered by an April shower to lay
the dust; the hedgerows shooting forth&mdash;buds
unfolding, flowers bursting out; the birds carolling
cheerfully, as if to welcome the return
of Spring; the sun smiling upon the snug
cottages, the picturesque village churches, the
small hamlets, the peaceful homesteads, the neatly-kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
gardens, whose early produce were beginning
to bloom&mdash;such were the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agréments</i> of the
road.</p>

<p>Every mile presented a new feature; the green
fields, the earth teeming with fertility, the velvet
lawns, the verdant fields, the luxuriant woods,
the peaceful valleys, the shady lanes, the
blossomed orchards, the "balmy odours" of
nature&mdash;her breath upon the breeze&mdash;all combined
to raise your dull spirits to a state of
ecstasy. Then the excitement as the well-appointed
"drag" drove through the village, the
guard sounding his cheerful horn, and the coach
pulled up for a snack at a cleanly wayside
public-house, where the buxom landlady and
the pretty barmaid dispensed the creature comforts
to the hungry guests, their appetites
sharpened by a drive of some twenty or five-and-twenty
miles.</p>

<p>They then turn to the rail, declaring that, instead
of the "balmy odours" of nature&mdash;her
breath upon the breeze&mdash;the traveller is nearly
suffocated with the rank smell of oil, smoke,
gas, and sulphur. Instead of gazing upon the
beauties of England's rural scenery, you are
whirled along at the rate of fifty miles an hour,
amidst the densest smoke, the groanings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
engines, through an embankment of chalk or
clay.</p>

<p>Just as you are contemplating a fine mountainous
view, a stately viaduct, a picturesque waterfall,
or a placid lake, another train meets yours,
and entirely hides the prospect from you. Instead
of the warm welcome at the inn, apostrophised
by Shenstone, or the less ostentatious,
although not less sincere, reception at the wayside
public-house, you are shown into a huge
room that reminds you of the spot where the
lions are wont to be fed at the Zoological
Gardens, where all is noise, hurry, and confusion;
where your pockets are emptied and your
inner man not filled, from the caloric qualities
of the food and the haste in which you are called
upon to devour it; and last, not least, they
compare the comfort of a barouche and four, a
chariot and pair, starting at your own hour,
stopping where you like, with the levelling system
of the rail, where high-born dames of great degree
are mixed with blacklegs and sharpers,
where the "hereditary pillars of the State" congregate
with Whitechapel "gents" and Corinthian
"swells," where prim old maids are "cheek by
jowl" with libertine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roués</i>, where young and
innocent boarding-school misses sit next to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
captains and needy fortune-hunters, where
unprincipled debtors are placed opposite their
clamorous creditors, where sage philosophers
come in collision with unchained lunatics, and
proud peeresses are brought in contact
with the frail and fair ones of the demimonde.</p>

<p>They then describe a stage-coach dinner, contrasting
it with one that could be had at all good
inns on the road when travelling luxuriously in
your own carriage. And they lay the scene at
the "Red Lion," Henley-on-Thames; at the
"Windmill," Salt-hill; at the "Pelican," Newbury;
at the "Bear," Reading; at the "Sugar-loaf,"
Dunstable; at the "Dun Cow," Dunchurch;
at the "Hop Pole," Worcester; at the
"King's Arms," Godalming; at the "Castle,"
Taunton; at the "Lion," Shrewsbury; at the
"Hand Inn," Llangollen, and at a variety of
other excellent inns, many of which have been
swept away since the introduction of the
rail.</p>

<p>They dwell upon the good old English country
fare, which did not require the foreign aid of
ornament. Not that they censure French cooking;
but what they find fault with&mdash;and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
heartily concur in this&mdash;is an attempt to transmogrify
native dishes into Continental ones by
what the newspaper advertisements term "a
professed woman cook," who is as fit to send up
a well-dressed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filet de volaille à la Parisienne</i>,
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maintenon cotelette</i>, or a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vol au vent à
la financière</i> as she would be to play a
match of polo at Hurlingham, or to take the
part of the Countess in the "<i>Mariage de
Figaro</i>."</p>

<p>The plain and perfect English dinners in
bygone days generally consisted of mutton broth,
rich in meat and herbs; fresh-water fish in
every form, eels stewed, fried, boiled, baked,
spitch-cocked, and water-suchet; the purest
bread and freshest butter; salmon and fennel
sauce; mackerel brought down by coach from
the Groves of London, with green gooseberries,
and the earliest cucumbers; a saddle of Southdown,
kept to a moment and done to a turn;
mutton chops, hot and hot; marrow-bones;
Irish stews; rump-steaks tender and juicy;
chicken and ham, plum-pudding, fruit tarts,
trifles, and gooseberry-fool. Then the produce
of the grape&mdash;no thin, washy claret, at eighteen
shillings a dozen; no fiery port, one day in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
bottle; no sherry at twenty-five guineas the
cask; but fine old crusted port, sherry dry and
fruity, madeira that had made more than one
voyage to India. Our readers must decide between
the two opinions.</p>

<p class="hanging indent">"MOVING ACCIDENTS" BY RAIL AND COACH&mdash;SHORT TIME
FOR THE ISSUE OF RAILWAY TICKETS&mdash;RECKLESS DRIVERS&mdash;AN
AFFAIR OF HONOUR&mdash;ANECDOTE OF THE LATE DUKE
OF WELLINGTON.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER VI.</p>

<p>A great deal has been written and said
upon the subject of accidents in travelling,
and comparisons have been made between those
caused by rail and road. There can be no
doubt that there has been an awful sacrifice of
life and an enormous amount of injury attributable
to the rail. Where hundreds formerly made
their journeys by public mails and stage-coaches,
or travelled in their own carriages, thousands
upon thousands are now conveyed by steam;
and out of those thousands how many are reckless
and foolish!&mdash;scrambling into the carriages
when they are moving, or rushing out before
they stop.</p>

<p>Although it would be, humanly speaking, impossible
to provide against accidents, for in or
after a frost ironwork cannot be depended upon;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
still, some might be averted by extra care and
diligence on the part of those to whom the
lives of Her Majesty's faithful subjects are entrusted.
I believe it is many years since an
accident has occurred on the London, Brighton,
and South Coast Railway; and this is mainly
owing to the unremitting attention of the general
manager, J. P. Knight, Esq., and his staff; and
probably there are other railways equally well
looked after and equally free from danger.</p>

<p>To render railway travelling safer than it now
is, the following rules should be adopted:&mdash;First
and foremost, the men should be better paid,
and not overworked; secondly, the telegraph
and signal duties should be placed in the hands
of responsible and intelligent persons; and last,
not least, punctuality in starting should be
rigidly enforced, for in making up for lost time
many have found to their cost that the old
hunting maxim has been realised, "It is the
pace that kills."</p>

<p>To carry out the latter, luggage should be sent
into the station a quarter of an hour before the
time of departure, and the doors closed to passengers
five minutes before the train leaves.
How often have I seen trains delayed in London
and at different stations in the country through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the late arrival of some persons of distinction!
The humbler classes do not fare quite as well,
for many a farmer's wife, country girl, labourer,
or mechanic has either been left behind or has
been hustled into the third class carriages, leaving
band-boxes, baskets, tools or implements on
the platform. It is only a few months ago that
I saw the above illustrated.</p>

<p>At&mdash;&mdash; station, just after the train was in
motion, a well-appointed waggonette drove up,
the coachman shouting "Wait a moment!"
The injunction was obeyed, the train was
stopped, and in about four or five minutes two
middle-aged ladies, a tiny specimen of the canine
race, a luncheon basket, dressing case, work-basket,
cloaks, umbrella, and parasols were
deposited in a first class compartment, and a
large amount of luggage placed in the van. The
darling little white, curly-haired pet, "Bijou" by
name, soon emancipated itself from the muff in
which it had been hid, much to the discomfiture
of myself and other occupants of the carriage!
Mark the contrast! After about an hour's journey
we stopped at a very rural station, and just
as the whistle was about to be blown a quiet,
respectable-looking female, evidently of the
humbler grade, rushed out of the office with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
merely a small basket in her hand, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Am I in time, guard?"</p>

<p>"Plenty," he responded, "for the next
train."</p>

<p>The whistle was heard, and the poor woman
left behind, to ruminate for four hours upon her
ill-luck.</p>

<p>There is another evil which many of the railways
have got rid of, and which we trust will
shortly be universally adopted&mdash;I refer to the
brief time allowed for taking tickets. In Glasgow
(I speak from experience) you may purchase
your ticket in offices appointed for the sale of
them independent of the railway station. To
the public this is a special boon, and upon one
occasion I found the benefit of it.</p>

<p>I was engaged to give a lecture at the City
Hall, Glasgow, which was to commence at eight
o'clock. The night train to London left at
twelve minutes after nine, so there was not
much time to spare. By taking my ticket in
the afternoon, leaving my portmanteau in the
cloak-room, engaging an intelligent porter to
take it out and have it ready for me, and benefiting
by the kindness of my host, Wm. Holms,
Esq., M.P. for Paisley, who conveyed me in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
his brougham from the lecture-hall to the station,
I arrived in time for the train, reaching my
London home in time for a ten o'clock breakfast,
with ample time, as the Yorkshireman says,
"to have a wash before a bite."</p>

<p>I now turn to accidents by road. These
were principally caused through the carelessness
of the drivers, a refractory team, a
coach that had not been thoroughly inspected
before starting, and occasionally by a coachman
who had imbibed a considerable quantity
of strong ale or fiery spirits. I could fill pages
with accidents that have occurred to stage-coaches,
in which many were killed and others
most severely hurt.</p>

<p>If I recollect right, a Worcester coach, descending
the steep hill into Severn Stoke, was
overturned, none of the passengers escaping
death; and on all the roads east, west, south,
and north of London frequent upsets took
place, more especially during the foggy month
of November, where ditches bounded the main
road.</p>

<p>I well remember travelling from Windsor to
London on the box of Moody's coach, driven
by "Young Moody," as he was called in contradistinction
to his father, the proprietor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
it. I was on the box seat; and after passing
Cranford Bridge a dense fog set in, one of
those fogs that are described as resembling the
colour of pea-soup. The coach was full inside
and out.</p>

<p>"I don't half like this," said Moody. "If I
can only manage to get safe to Hounslow, I'll
have the lamps lit."</p>

<p>In those days lucifer-matches were quite
unknown, so to get a light from any of
the passengers was impossible; not so would
it be at the present time, when almost every
one carries with his pipe or cigar a box of
matches.</p>

<p>Scarcely had my box companion uttered the
above words when we were upset, an accident
caused by our driving into a deep, broad ditch.
I and the outsiders were pitched into the furze
on the heath, anything but a bed of roses, while
the insides were screeching for help. Some
of us ran to the horses to keep them quiet,
others lent their aid in extricating three middle-aged
ladies and an elderly gentleman who
were confined in what one of the females
described as the "opaque body of a stage-coach."</p>

<p>After some trouble things were put to rights;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
happily, no one being severely injured. Thinking
it more than probable that if we attempted
to proceed on our journey without lamps we
should meet with another mishap, I got a
labouring friend who came to our assistance
to walk to the "Travellers' Friend," and borrow
two lanthorns. This he accordingly did;
so with the aid of our own lamps and the
above lights we managed to reach Hounslow in
safety. From Hounslow to London we had
difficulties to contend against, for the dim oily
rays of a few lamps and lights in shops
had not then given way to the brilliancy of
gas.</p>

<p>A few years afterwards, when travelling inside
the Henley coach, an axletree broke, and
we were upset into a drift of snow&mdash;soft, but
rather cooling. Upon this occasion an outside
passenger had his arm fractured.</p>

<p>My third and fourth upsets from private carriages
will be duly recorded.</p>

<p>It occasionally happened that driving out or
into a yard, despite the warning "Take care of
your heads," some half-sleepy or inattentive
passenger met with a serious accident by his
head coming in contact with the roof. Then,
again, a skid would come off the wheel going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
down hill at an awful pace, which, of course,
brought the passengers to grief. An inveterate
kicker or a giber added to the dangers of the
road, and a heavy snowstorm, in which the
passengers had to descend and make their way
to the nearest wayside inn or cottage, did not
improve their condition.</p>

<p>Of course when due precautions were taken,
the accidents were, comparatively speaking,
few. I have travelled at a tremendous pace by
the "Hirondelle"&mdash;irreverently called the "Iron
Devil"&mdash;by the "Wonder," between Shrewsbury
and London, and by almost all the fast
coaches between London and Brighton, London
and Oxford, London and Southampton,
London and Bath, and have never met with the
slightest accident.</p>

<p>In bygone days it was very agreeable, albeit
rather expensive, to travel post, especially in
your own light chariot or britchka; but to be
dependent upon hack chaises on the road was
far from pleasant. These chaises were not very
well hung on springs, the windows seldom fitted
closely, and the rattling noise reminded one of
a dice-box in full play upon wheels. There
was generally straw enough at your feet to
hold a covey of partridges. Although these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
vehicles were light and followed well, a great
deal of time was wasted in shifting your luggage
from one to another at every stage, or, at most,
every other stage.</p>

<p>I once left London on an affair of importance&mdash;namely,
that of carrying a hostile message
from a friend to a gentleman who resided near
Marlborough, and found it so difficult to rouse
the ostler, postboy, and the man who looked
after the chaises, that I got no farther than
Botham's at Salt Hill.</p>

<p>I left the Piazza Coffee-House, where the
letter had been concocted demanding an apology
or a meeting, about eleven at night, was kept
waiting for more than a half hour at the "Red
Lion," Hounslow, and only reached Salt Hill
about half-past one in the morning. There,
again, had I to awake the sleepy ostler and
drowsy waiter, the latter of whom strenuously
recommended me to sleep at the hotel and continue
my journey at daylight. This I accordingly
did; but what with the arrangement of the affair
of honour, as it was called, and which ended
amicably, I was nearly two-and-twenty hours
on the journey by road that could now be accomplished
with ease by rail in less than
seven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
I have alluded to two upsets that I have in
the course of my life met with from private
travelling-carriages. The first occurred in July,
1814, when returning with the late Duke of
Wellington from Windsor to London. His Grace
had been dining with the officers of the Royal
Horse Guards (Blues), in which regiment I
had the honour of holding a commission, when,
as we reached Brentford, at night, the linch
pin came out of the fore wheel of his carriage,
by which it was upset.</p>

<p>Nothing would satisfy the people but drawing
the carriage to London, which they certainly
would have done but for the remonstrance of
his Grace, which finally succeeded. After a
delay of half an hour the damage was repaired,
and we reached London in safety. The accident
might have proved a fatal one, for we were
travelling as fast as four good horses could take
us.</p>

<p>Had such a calamity happened to Wellington,
then in the prime of life, no one
can hardly picture the consequences. Happily
his life was spared to add another
conquest to those he had won on the banks
of the Douro, of the Tagus, the Ebro, and the
Garonne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
The second and last upset I had was on the
night of my return from Canada, in 1819,
when, in driving through Goodwood Park, the
postboys drove over a bank and, to use a common
expression, "floored the coach."</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER VII.</p>

<p>Travelling by road in Ireland was and is
very different from what it was and is in
England. The mail and stage-coaches, almost
similar to the English ones, were well-horsed,
and kept their time very regularly. Occasionally
"a frolicsome baste," or "rale bit of blood who
won the plate at the Curragh," would start off
at a tremendous pace, upset the "drag," the
driver assuring the passengers that they were
the "quietest craythures in Ireland," adding,
"I'll give it ye, ye bastes, ye venomous sarpints,
when I get ye home."</p>

<p>The harness, too, was not a little the worse
for wear, having so often been mended with
string and rope that in descending a hill it
would break into "smithereens," and now and
then, when whisky was in the ascendant, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Jehu was so venturesome that in descending a
hill he would come to grief.</p>

<p>After a time the public cars, introduced by
M. Bianconi displaced the regular coaches.
In form they resembled the common outside
jaunting-car, but were calculated to hold from
twelve to sixteen persons. They were admirably
horsed, had steady drivers, the team
generally consisting of three horses, which
travelled at the rate of seven Irish miles an
hour, equivalent to nine English miles, the fares
averaging twopence a mile. They were open
cars, but a huge leather apron afforded protection
from showers of rain, which are so
prevalent in the sister isle. Post-chaises, which
are now nearly extinct, were awful conveyances.</p>

<p>I have a very lively impression of a journey
from Cork to Dublin some fifty years ago in
these vehicles; the one furnished by the proprietor
of the Imperial Hotel, Cork (then, and
I believe now, an excellent hôtellerie), which
took me the first stage, was clean and comfortable;
not so those that followed. Springs
they appeared to have none; or, if they had,
they were so covered with rope that there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
no elasticity left in them. They rattled worse
than any fire-engine.</p>

<p>The roof was so dilapidated and the windows
so broken that, except for the honour of the
thing, you might as well have had no covering
at all; the harness came to pieces whenever
"Paddy" gave his horses a spurt, and
the cattle were "divels to go." So disagreeable
did I find the journey in a post-chaise
that at Youghal I engaged a car,
and prosecuted my journey to Dublin in
cars.</p>

<p>Persons who have never travelled in Ireland
in these conveyances can have a very inadequate
idea of the ready wit of the drivers. It
has been admirably well told by Mr. and Mrs.
S. C. Hall, from whose work on the scenery
and character of Ireland I quote the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some one told a story of a fellow who, on
grumbling at the shilling gratuity at his journey's
end, said, in a sly undertone,</p>

<p>"Faith, it's not putting me off ye'd be if ye
knew but all."</p>

<p>The traveller's curiosity was excited.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, faix! that ud be telling."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Another shilling was tendered.</p>

<p>"And now," asked the gentleman, "what
do you mean by saying if ye knew but
all?"</p>

<p>"That I driv yer honour the last three
miles without a linchpin!"</p>

<p>"Will I pay the pike or drive at it, plase
yer honour?" was the exclamation of a driver
to his passenger as he suddenly drew up a few
yards from the turnpike gate.</p>

<p>When an Assistant Poor-Law Commissioner
first visited Cork, the coach by which he arrived
set him down next door to the "Imperial Hotel,"
his place of destination. Not being aware of
this fact, he ordered a car and gave his direction
to the driver. The fellow conducted him
round the town and through the various streets
and lanes, and, after an hour's driving, placed
him at the hotel entrance, demanding and receiving
a sum of five shillings, which his victim
considered a reasonable charge. A few minutes
afterwards he discovered the trick that had been
played upon him.</p>

<p>One of the richest characters of the class
we encountered on the road from Ross to
Wexford; he told us how he got his first
situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
"The masther had two beautiful English
horses, and he wanted a careful man to drive
them; he was a mighty plisant gentleman,
and loved a joke. Well, there was as many as
fifteen after the place, and the first that wint up
to him was examined as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Now, my man,' says he, 'tell me,' says
he, 'how near the edge of a precipice would
you undertake to drive my carriage?'</p>

<p>"So the boy considered, and he says, says
he,</p>

<p>"'Within a foot, plaze your honour, and no
harm.'</p>

<p>"'Very well,' says he, 'go down, I'll give ye
yer answer, by-and-by.'</p>

<p>"So the next came up, and said he'd be
bound to carry 'em within half a foot; and
the next said five inches; and another&mdash;a dandified
chap intirely&mdash;was so mighty nice that
he would drive it within 'three inches and a
half, he'd go bail.'</p>

<p>"Well, at last my turn came, and when
his honour axed me how nigh I would
drive his carriage to a precipice, I said,
says I,</p>

<p>"'Plaze, yer honour, I'd keep as far off it as
I could.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
"'Very well, Misther Byrne,' says he, 'you're
my coachman,' says he.</p>

<p>"Och! the roar there was in the kitchen whin
I wint down and tould the joke!"</p>

<p>I heard a good story of the philanthropic
Peabody, who, though princely in his liberality,
did not like to be imposed upon. Upon one
occasion he resisted an exorbitant demand,
and only gave the car-driver his proper
fare!</p>

<p>"Bedad!" said the man; "they may call
you Mr. Paybody, but I call you Mr. Paynobody."</p>

<p>Another instance will suffice. As Sir Walter
Scott was riding with a friend in the neighbourhood
of Abbotsford, he came to a field-gate,
which an Irish beggar, who happened to be
near, hastened to open for him. Sir Walter was
desirous of rewarding this civility by the present
of sixpence, but found that he had not so small a
coin in his purse.</p>

<p>"Here, my good fellow," said the Baronet,
"here is a shilling for you, but mind you owe me
sixpence."</p>

<p>"God bless your honour," exclaimed Pat,
"may your honour live till I pay you."</p>

<p>The Irish car is so peculiar and characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
an institution that a brief sketch of the author
of the system may not be here out of place. Mr.
Charles Bianconi, a native of Milan, came over
to Ireland in the year 1800, and set up at
Clonmel as a picture-dealer. Struck with the
want of accommodation that existed between the
various towns of the district, an idea entered
his head of remedying the deficiency by introducing
a new conveyance. He had heard that
Derrick, in 1760, had been compelled to set out
on horseback on a journey from Cork to Killarney,
there being no public carriage to be had in the
city of Cork.</p>

<p>Between that period and 1800 no great improvement
had taken place; so the enterprising
Italian, who had saved some money, started a
car between Clonmel and Cahir. After struggling
for some time against all the difficulties
that ever attend a new scheme, after inciting the
people to abandon their indifference, to conquer
their prejudices, he so far succeeded as to
enable him to run others to Limerick and
Thurles.</p>

<p>The public, hitherto apathetic, were roused
into action; the new scheme met with universal
patronage; soon Bianconi's name was uppermost
in everyone's thoughts; the double cars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
increased to nearly fifty in number, travelling
daily over nearly four thousand miles. These
vehicles were so constructed as to carry numerous
passengers and a large amount of luggage;
they were all built at the inventor's factory at
Clonmel; they travelled at the rate of six to
nine statute miles an hour, and were admirably
well adapted for all who journeyed for business
or pleasure. For tourists they were invaluable,
as from the cars extensive views of the country
might be seen; moreover, the driver was always
so full of genuine fun that he enlivened the
whole journey with his quaint Milesian sayings.</p>

<p>Generally, too, he was well acquainted with
the locality, and would tell amusing anecdotes
of the occupiers of the stately mansions in the
neighbourhood, and of their humbler neighbours.
The rail has in a great measure driven cars off
the road, but they are still to be had at all the
principal towns and at almost every village in
Ireland.</p>

<p>The wit of the drivers is not at all deteriorated,
and the cattle they drive are first-rate. Upon a
recent occasion I engaged a car at Inistioge, in
the county of Kilkenny, from one Mr. Cassin, to
take me to New Ross; the distance is nearly ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
English miles, and the driver, who had an eye
for the picturesque, insisted upon taking me one
way and bringing me back another; and from the
time I left until my return I was kept in a fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>Upon dismissing "Paddy" I asked him what
I had to pay.</p>

<p>"Five shillings, yer honour, for the car, and
whatever you plaze for the driver."</p>

<p>"But if I plaze to give you nothing?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, yer honour, I'll be perfectly
satisfied, as you are quite a credit to the
car."</p>

<p>A good story is told of a car-driver who was
conveying a tourist through a most picturesque
part of Ireland, when all of a sudden the
"baste" began to kick, and showed evident
symptoms of going faster down a hill than
the unfortunate occupier of the car approved
of.</p>

<p>"Don't whip him, driver, or you'll make him
run away."</p>

<p>"Bedad, yer honour, ye needn't be afeard of
that. He's a raal sodjer, and 'ud sooner die than
run away."</p>

<p>I must now take leave of Ireland and return to
England.</p>

<p class="hanging indent">COACH ACCIDENTS&mdash;ACCIDENT FROM RACING&mdash;ACTIONS AT

<p class="title2">CHAPTER VIII.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the numerous
accidents that occurred on the road to stage
and mail coaches, and could fill a volume with
casualties caused by overturns, violent driving,
horses proceeding miles without drivers, drunken
coachmen, low gateways, overloading, breaking
down, and racing. One of the most memorable
events connected with racing occurred in
1820, when Thomas Perdy and George Butler
were charged at the Hertford Assizes with the
wilful murder of William Hart, who was thrown
off the Holyhead Mail, of which Perdy was the
driver, and which had been upset by the Chester
Mail, of which Butler was the driver. The
grand jury having thrown out the bill for the
capital offence, they were tried on a charge of
manslaughter. Two witnesses who were suffering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
severely from the accident deposed to the
following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Archer, a respectable bootmaker, of
Cheapside, London, stated that he sat on the
box with the prisoner Perdy. When the coach
arrived at that part of the road beyond Highgate,
where a junction is formed between the Archway
Road and the old Highgate Road, the Chester
Mail came up. Both coachmen began to whip
their horses and put them into a gallop, and
drove abreast of each other at a furious rate
for a considerable distance, when the driver of
the Chester Mail slackened the pace of his
horses, and seemed conscious of the impropriety
of his conduct; but when the coaches
approached towards St. Albans, and had arrived
at the hill about a mile from that town, the
prisoner Perdy put his horses into a furious
gallop down the hill. His example was followed
by the other prisoner, who endeavoured to
overtake him; and a most terrific race ensued
between the two carriages, the velocity of both
increasing by their own accelerated descent
down an abrupt hill.</p>

<p>The road was wide enough for three carriages
to pass each other; but the prisoner Butler,
perceiving that Perdy was keeping ahead of him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
pushed his horses on, and waving his hat and
cheering, suddenly turned his leaders in front of
the leaders of the Holyhead Mail, which, in consequence
of being jammed in between the bank
of the road and the other vehicle, was immediately
upset. The consequences were frightful.
The deceased was killed on the spot, the witness
had a leg and an arm shattered most dreadfully;
and a gentleman's servant, named Fenner, was
taken up almost lifeless.</p>

<p>Thomas Fenner confirmed the last witness.
He stated that both the prisoners were flogging
their horses at a most furious rate down the
hill, and he was convinced that the accident
might have been avoided with common care,
notwithstanding the velocity with which the
horses were driven, as there was quite room
enough for the Chester Mail to have passed the
Holyhead.</p>

<p>Mr. Baron Gurney summed up the case for
the jury in an eloquent and impressive manner.
The jury found the prisoners "Guilty."</p>

<p>The learned Judge, in passing sentence,
commented on the conduct of the prisoners in
terms of strong animadversion. His Lordship
laid it down distinctly, as a proposition not to
be disputed, that it was unlawful for the driver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
to put his horses into a gallop, and that he was
answerable for all the consequences of an infringement
of this law. The driver of a stage-coach
was bound to protect even the intoxicated,
the blind, the aged, and the helpless against
their own want of caution or imprudence. The
case now before the Court presented circumstances
of gross aggravation, and his Lordship
felt it his duty to pronounce the severest judgment
that the law would allow, which was
that the prisoners should be severally confined
in the common gaol of this county for the term
of one year.</p>

<p>At the Wiltshire Assizes in 1813, an action
was brought by a Mr. Gooden against the proprietors
of a mail coach, to recover damages
for a serious injury sustained by the plaintiff,
from its being overturned. It appeared in
evidence that the plaintiff was an outside
passenger, that the coach was overturned immediately
on quitting the yard of the "Red
Lion Inn," Salisbury, and that a compound
fracture of the plaintiff's leg was the consequence
of the accident. It seemed established
that there was no gross misconduct on the part of
the coachman to call for vindictive damages. Mr.
Justice Gibbs left it to the jury to determine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
whether the defendants were liable on account
of the apparent heedlessness of the coachman
in not leading the horses out of the yard, and
it was agreed that if the jury found the defendants
liable, the verdict should pass for all such
expenses as the plaintiff had reasonably incurred,
which were to be ascertained by a reference.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and
the referee assessed the damages at six hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>In the same year there was an inquest held
upon a woman who was run over by a Manchester
coach, and the verdict was "Accidental
death," with a deodand of four pounds on
the fore horse.</p>

<p>On the night of November the 23rd, 1696,
six highwaymen attacked the Ware coach on
Stamford Hill, and after the customary amount
of imprecations, led the horses, vehicle, and
passengers under a gibbet; they then proceeded
to rifle each individual, and tore out the
breeches-pockets, and the skirts from the waistcoats
of the gentlemen, to be certain of
their contents, which amounted to above a
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>At the moment the thieves had completed
their intentions, a gentleman's servant passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
with a cart; the man was immediately summoned
to surrender, which he did without resistance;
part of the lading of this prize proved
to be several hampers of wine.</p>

<p>Elated by the success of the evening, the
highwaymen opened the hampers, seized the
bottles, and emptied many in repeated healths
to the owner of the liquid, which expanding
the generous nature of the six, they insisted
upon the stage coachman and his passengers
solacing themselves for their misfortunes by
repeated applications to the favourite beverage
of the "Rosy God;" then presenting each with
two bottles, they were dismissed on their
journey in a state nearly approaching intoxication.</p>

<p>A horseman coming by, they robbed him of
his palfrey, but plied him so hotly with their
liquor that he seemed very little sensible of
his loss; so that stumbling to his inn in his
boots, with a bottle in each hand, he made all
that he found in the kitchen drink of his
wine, and gave them no small diversion by
acting the story and knocking down several of
the company, as the thieves did him.</p>

<p>The person who afforded this diversion to
his auditor and spectators on the memorable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
night of the robbery, appears to have retained
much of the good-humour produced by the
plundered wine when he wrote and sent the
following advertisement to the editor of the
"Flying Post:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whereas some gentlemen of a profession
that takes denomination from the King's highway,
did borrow a little money of a certain
person, near the gibbet at Stamford Hill, without
any regard to that venerable monitor, on
the 23rd of November last, at night; and though
they were so generous as to make him drink for
his money, yet at the same time they took from
him a bright bay nag about thirteen hands high,
his mane shorn, thorough-paced, trots a little,
with a saddle, bridle, and pilch, without either
bargain or promise of payment. He hopes they
think his horse worth more than two or three
bottles of wine, and desires they would restore
him; or if anybody can give notice of him to
George Boon at the 'Blue Last,' in Islington, so
he may be had again, shall receive ten shillings
reward."</p>

<p>In the year 1829, about nine o'clock in the
morning, the "Albion" coach took up as passengers
twelve convicts from Chester, who had been
sentenced to transportation for life for various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
offences, and who were to be forwarded to
Portsmouth, for which purpose a Portsmouth
coach was to meet them at the "Bull and
Mouth," London. The coach had no other passengers
except the two keepers who had charge
of the convicts.</p>

<p>About nine in the evening the coach reached
Birmingham, where a new coachman and guard
relieved the former ones, and the coach proceeded
to Elmedon, where the convicts partook
of some refreshment. After having gone on four
miles to Meriden, the guard's attention was
arrested by hearing one of the convicts filing the
chain attached to his handcuffs. Without apparently
noticing the noise, he contrived to apprise
the keeper of the circumstance, who took the
guard's situation behind, the guard placing himself
by the side of the coachman on the box.
After this alteration everything became quiet,
and there were no appearances of an attempt at
escape.</p>

<p>The coach now approached Coventry, through
which it passed; and after it had proceeded nine
miles, in a sequestered part of the road, where
trees extend on each side upwards of six miles,
and not a house is near, in an instant four of
the convicts seized hold of the coachman and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
guard, stopped the horses, and succeeded in
fastening both coachman and guard with cords
and straps. While this was going on, they stated
that they did not intend to injure them or rob
the coach, but were determined at every hazard
to regain their liberty. While this scene was
going on in front of the coach, five other convicts
seized the keeper behind, and rifling his
pockets obtained the keys of the handcuffs.</p>

<p>The confusion outside was the signal to the
remaining convicts within; instantly the keeper
was laid hold of and confined, and, having got
possession of his handcuff-keys also, they lost
no time in manacling him. The convicts then
descended, and began endeavouring to extricate
themselves from their fetters, a work which
occupied them some time, and in which, notwithstanding
their violence and ingenuity, they made
very little progress.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, they were suddenly
alarmed by the noise of a coach approaching,
and immediately rushed to the fields. As the
night was exceedingly dark, they succeeded
in making their escape before the "Alliance,"
Liverpool coach, came up, by which time the
guard and coachman had extricated themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
and were assisting in unbinding the keepers.
Before the convicts were alarmed by the Liverpool
coach, they had detached the horses from
the "Albion," probably, if necessary, to make
use of them in their flight. Most of them were
soon retaken.</p>

<p>On the 13th an accident happened to the "Red
Rover," Manchester and London coach. When
it arrived at Stone, about twelve o'clock at night,
it had ten outside passengers and one inside. It
stopped as usual at the "Falcon Inn" to change
horses. When the fresh horses were put to,
eight of the outside passengers had resumed their
seats, the gentleman inside retaining his place.
The coachman and guard were one of them in the
yard, and the other in the kitchen of the inn.
The horses started off, turned the sharp corner
of the road leading to Stafford, and proceeded
at a moderate pace. The outside passengers, on
perceiving their situation, began to jump off
the coach, and by the time the coach had proceeded
a quarter of a mile on the road every
outside passenger had quitted it. In their
falls they all received injuries more or less
severe.</p>

<p>After the outside passengers had left the
"Red Rover," the horses still pursued their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
course, and when the Birmingham and Liverpool
Mail met them near Ashton they were going
at a comparatively steady pace. The "Beehive"
afterwards met them near the turnpike gate,
at which they were on the full gallop. They
avoided, however, any collision with the "Beehive,"
as they had previously done with the
mail.</p>

<p>On arriving at Tillington, about a mile from
Stafford, the coach was upset. The gentleman
inside, having early learned the situation in
which he was placed, took his seat on the floor
of the coach, and did not stir during the whole
time; the consequence was that he escaped without
the slightest injury.</p>

<p>In August, 1839, on the arrival of the Falmouth
Mail at Bodmin, many persons, as is
usual at the assizes, were waiting to proceed by
it to Exeter, and four inside and three outside
passengers were taken up there. The coach was
driven by a man who was not the regular
coachman, but was considered to be an experienced
and sober man. The guard was a young
man who had been but recently placed upon that
station, and was not very well accustomed to the
road.</p>

<p>After proceeding a short distance the passengers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
perceived that the driver was very much
intoxicated, and they insisted that he should
not drive the coach further; accordingly the
guard took the reins, and the coachman took his
seat behind.</p>

<p>Shortly before reaching the "Jamaica Inn,"
situate on Bodmin Moors, and ten miles from
that town, there is a very steep descent, with a
sharp turn at the bottom of the hill, and then
a steep ascent up to the inn, where the coach
changes horses, and its proper time of arrival
was about twelve o'clock. The people at the
public-house were alarmed by several horses
galloping up to the door and then stopping, and
upon going out they discovered they were the
mail horses, but with scarcely any harness upon
them.</p>

<p>It appeared that the guard intended to drag
the wheel down the hill, but, the night being
very dark and wet, and not well knowing the
road, he had got beyond the brow of the hill
before he was aware of it; he endeavoured to
pull up, and it was believed the coachman got
down to tie the wheel, but that he was too tipsy
and fell down. The coach then proceeded down
the hill at a most frightful pace. Being heavily
laden, it rocked from side to side, and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
getting to the turn over it went with the most
dreadful crash. The horses fortunately at once
broke away. All the passengers were more
or less stunned, and many of those outside
were seriously injured with fractured ribs and
bones.</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER IX.</p>

<p>One of the most serious accidents was caused
by the breaking down of the Hertford
coach, by which nearly all the passengers,
thirty-four in number, were severely hurt.</p>

<p>An extraordinary occurrence connected with
the road occurred in April, 1820, when a
gentleman of noble connection, high fashion,
and large fortune had his carriage and horses
seized on their way from Brighton to London,
in consequence of the carriage containing smuggled
goods. A replevin was afterwards effected,
on the payment of five hundred pounds. The
real state of the case was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The coachman had the folly to secrete two
half-ankers of Hollands gin within the vehicle;
and his fellow-servant, the footman, angry
at not being let into the secret, laid an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
information, and the seizure of the carriage and
horse was the consequence.</p>

<p>Although, unfortunately, there have been of
late years many fatal accidents by rail, caused
by carelessness, inattention, and the over-working
of pointsmen and others employed on the
respective lines, I question much, taking into
consideration the thousands on thousands that
travel by steam, as compared with those that
journeyed by the road, whether the accidents
were not as serious and as numerous in
the days of coaching as they now are.</p>

<p>I shall confine myself to mail and stage-coaches,
albeit private carriages and post-chaises
were not exempt from breakings down,
upsets, and other casualties, caused by
drunken or reckless drivers, runaway horses,
or by fragile springs, wheels, axletrees, and
poles.</p>

<p>Macaulay, as I have already said, in describing
the mishaps that befell Prince George of Denmark
and his suite when visiting the stately
mansion of Petworth, draws a favourable contrast
between the effects of an accident on the
road in bygone days and a railway collision in
our time; but the great historian would have
thought differently had he been aware of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
dangers of the road which I am about to
record.</p>

<p>Prince George and his courtiers were overturned
and stuck fast in the mud upon their
journey; but, at the pace they travelled at,
no serious consequence was to be apprehended&mdash;they
were six hours going nine
miles.</p>

<p>I will now select out of a number a few
cases of accidents caused by the inclemency
of the weather, carelessness, and reckless
driving.</p>

<p>It often happened that during heavy snowstorms
travelling was impracticable. In March,
1827, the storm was so violent in Scotland
that the mails, especially those from the South,
were stopped for several days, although no snow
had fallen further south than Carlisle.</p>

<p>On many parts of the road between Carlisle,
Edinburgh, and Glasgow a path had to be cut
out by the labour of men the whole way; the
snow was so deep as to rise in many places
above the heads of the outside passengers of
the stage-coaches, while those in the inside
saw nothing on their right and on their left
but rough walls of snow.</p>

<p>The mails dispatched from Glasgow to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
south were twenty-four hours proceeding to
Douglas Mill, and the mail from Glasgow to
Edinburgh only proceeded three miles, though
drawn by six horses. The guard and coachman
set forward with the mail-bags on horseback,
and with great exertion reached Holytown,
seven miles further, in as many hours.</p>

<p>On the following morning another attempt
was made, but, after proceeding a mile, both
coachman and guard were obliged to return to
Holytown. A number of men were then employed
to clear the road, and at three o'clock
in the afternoon they made a second attempt,
but could only reach Shotts, as the men engaged
in cutting the road were obliged to desist, in
consequence of the wind filling up the path as
fast as they cleared it. Next morning they
started again at half-past five, and only reached
Edinburgh, in a very exhausted state, in about
twelve hours.</p>

<p>Again, in 1837 one of the heaviest falls of
snow ever remembered in this country took
place on the Christmas night. It extended
over every part of the kingdom. So deep
were the drifts of snow that in some of the
lower grounds it was from forty feet to fifty
feet deep; thus in many parts of the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
all communication by the usual modes of
travelling was entirely suspended. The impediments
to the mails were of the most
serious description. Not a single mail of the
26th of December, which ought to have arrived
by six o'clock on Monday morning,
reached the Post Office before half-past eight
in the evening. Of the mails sent out from
London on Christmas night, the Dover went
twenty miles and returned, the coachman and
guard declaring the roads to be utterly impassable.
The letters were conveyed daily
from Canterbury to Dover on sledges drawn
by three and four horses, tandem. Occasionally
they were forwarded by means of pack-horses.
The fare for a passenger on a sledge
was two pounds.</p>

<p>Occasionally passengers suffered from the
inclemency of the weather. On one occasion
when the Bath coach arrived at Chippenham,
the people of the inn were surprised at seeing
three outside passengers lying in a state of
insensibility. On a nearer approach they perceived
that vitality had been actually extinct
in two of them for some time, the bodies
being perfectly cold. The third, a soldier, had
some faint signs of animation left, but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
expired the following morning. On the above
fatal night it rained incessantly, and the cold
was intense.</p>

<p>In 1838 one of the most terrible storms
of thunder and lightning that had been witnessed
for many years took place on the
28th of August, during which the Royal Mail,
on its way from York to Leeds, was overturned
a short distance before its arrival at
Tadcaster. The vivid glare of the lightning
and the roar of the thunder so affrighted the
horses that they started off, ran the coach
upon an embankment, and it was instantly
overturned. There were three inside and
three outside passengers, besides the coachman
and guard, all of whom, with the
exception of the coachman, escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>A more serious accident occurred in October.
Whilst the Coburg coach, on its way from
Perth to Edinburgh, was receiving the passengers
and luggage from Newhalls Pier, South
Queensferry, the leaders suddenly wheeled round,
and, notwithstanding that the guard and coachman
were almost instantly at their heads, coach
and horses were precipitated over the quay. Some
of the outside passengers escaped by throwing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
themselves on the pier, but those in the
inside were less fortunate. The inside passengers
consisted of three ladies and one
gentleman. The coach having fallen into the
sea on its side, one lady and gentleman
managed to get their heads thrust out of the
window above the water till extricated from
their perilous situation; the other two were
taken out dead. The only outside passenger
who kept his place on the coach until it was
precipitated into the water was pitched into
the sea a considerable distance, but, fortunately,
saved himself by swimming ashore.
The pole having broken, the leaders were
saved, but the two wheel horses were
drowned.</p>

<p>Another accident occurred at Galashiels, where
there is a bridge uniting two curves of the
road; upon reaching it one of the horses
commenced kicking, and in a few moments
had its hind legs over the bar. The coachman
tried to arrest their progress, but his
efforts were useless, and the coach was overturned
in a few seconds. At that time there
were four persons inside; one lady had her
arm broken, and a gentleman had his leg
broken; the other passengers sustained serious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
injuries, one dying at Galashiels from the
effect of the injuries he sustained.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock the same night the North
Briton coach was approaching Chorley, in
Lancashire. The coach was meeting some
waggons, and was followed by a number of
carts. The coachman, to escape the waggons,
drew on the opposite side, and, owing to the
mist, went too far, and plunged the vehicle
down a precipice. One man was killed on the
spot.</p>

<p>During the floods in Scotland, in 1829, the
coast mail-coach, having left Fochabers at
four <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, got forward, without any interruption,
to the Spey, where, in consequence of the
boisterous rapidity of the torrent, sweeping
along with it corn and wood in great abundance,
the boatmen were with difficulty
prevailed on to ferry the guard across.
They stated their determination not to venture
again while the current remained so strong.
(Since that period a substantial bridge has
been thrown over the Spey.) On his way to
the Findhorn the guard of the mail-coach called
on Mr. Davidson, who resides about two miles
to the eastward of that river. He accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
the guard, and promptly procured six men to
carry the mails across the river, which was
done with scarcely any detention, although
the ebbing current was fearfully strong.
Four of Mr. Davidson's men then volunteered
their services and carried the bags on their
backs to Earnhill, where the guard procured
a horse and cart, in which he proceeded to
Dyke. There the Reverend Mr. Anken was
waiting in readiness, with his servants and
several lights, to assist to forward the mail.
One of the servants from the manse waded
before the cart for upwards of a mile, the
water covering the road, in many places to
the depth of three feet. In Auldearn the
guard was met by the Reverend Mr. Barclay,
who informed him that the bridge of Nairn had
been swept away.</p>

<p>After a most boisterous night the cart arrived
opposite to Nairn, where, the guard blowing
his horn, several persons instantly came forward
and advised him not to attempt to cross
the bridge, a great part of it having fallen.
Finding it, however, impossible to get a boat,
he drove the cart back to Auldearn, where he
remained till three o'clock in the morning, when
he again set out on his way to Inverness; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
there being still from two to three feet in breadth
of the bridge standing, he, with great peril,
passed it.</p>

<p>Great apprehensions were entertained that
the bridge of Daviot would have been swept
away, although founded on a rock considerably
beyond the usual height of the water. If this
bridge had been carried away the communication
with the south by this road, at least for carriages
and carts, would have been completely cut off,
as there is no place within four miles of the
Highland road where the river is fordable.
After much toil and perseverance the
guard reached his destination at Inverness.</p>

<p>In July, 1827, the Bath mail-coach was overturned
on its way from London, between
Reading and Newbury, in consequence of the
horses taking fright and bolting from the road
into a gravel-pit. The coachman was thrown
from the box among the horses, and received
several contusions from being trod upon. The
guard and a foreigner, who were on the top, were
precipitated by the shock to such a distance,
and with such violence, as would probably have
proved fatal to them had not the earth and
gravel on which they lighted been saturated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the rain that fell in the course of the day; and
to the same cause may be ascribed the trifling
injury done to the horses and the coach. In a
few minutes after the accident took place a
Bath coach came up. The passengers rendered
every assistance in their power, and, with some
difficulty, succeeded in extricating the inside
passengers from the mail. Among them was a
naval officer who was going to join his ship at
Plymouth, but he had suffered so much from the
concussion that he was speechless and unable to
move. He was conveyed to a small cottage
on the roadside, but died the following
day.</p>

<p>In December of the same year, as the Salisbury
coach was on its journey to London, the
fog was so thick that the coachman could not
see his way, and on entering Bedfont, near
Hounslow, the horses went off the road into the
pond called the King's Water, dragging the
coach along with them. One of the passengers,
Mr. Lockhart Wainwright, a young man of
five-and-twenty years of age, belonging to the
Light Dragoons, was killed on the spot. The
water was about two feet deep, with a soft
bottom of mud about two feet more. Whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
he was suffocated in the mud or killed by a blow
was not ascertained.</p>

<p>In the inside of the coach were four females&mdash;the
wife of the deceased, her maid, a Swiss
governess in the family of the Marquis of Abercorn,
and another lady. They all narrowly
escaped drowning. Nothing but the speedy
assistance from Bedfont could have saved them.
Above one hundred persons were assembled in a
few moments, most of them soldiers from Bedfont.
The soldiers leaped into the water and
extricated the ladies from their perilous situation;
the body of the coach lying on its side,
with one of the horses drowned, and the rest
kicking and plunging violently. The inside
passengers were bruised, but not dangerously.
Mr. Wainwright owed his death to his humanity.
The night being very severe he had given his
place inside to his wife's maid, and mounted
the box beside the coachman, with whom he
was conversing at the time of the accident.</p>

<p>In April, 1826, the Dorking coach left the
"Elephant and Castle" at nine o'clock, full inside
and out, and arrived safe at Ewell, when the
driver and proprietor, Joseph Walker, alighted
for the purpose of delivering a parcel from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
back part of the coach, and gave the reins to
a boy who sat on the box.</p>

<p>While he was delivering the parcel to a person
who stood near the after wheel of the coach
the boy cracked the whip, and the horses set
off at full speed. Several attempts were made
to stop them, but in vain; they passed Ewell
church, and tore away about twelve yards of
strong paling, when, the wheels mounting a
small eminence, the coach was overturned, and
the whole of the passengers were thrown from
the roof. Some of them were in a state of
insensibility, showing no symptoms of life.
One female, who was thrown upon some
spikes, which entered her breast and neck,
was dreadfully mutilated, none of her features
being distinguishable; she lingered until the
following day, when she expired in the greatest
agony.</p>

<p>While the "True Blue" coach, which ran
daily between Leeds and Wakefield, was descending
Belle-hill (the precaution of locking
the wheel not having been observed) the
horses got into a gallop, and at the bottom,
the coach being on the wrong side of the
road, came in contact with a coal-cart with
such violence as to break the shaft of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
cart and to tear away the wheel of the
coach with a part of the axletree. The coachman
was thrown from the box and pitched
with his head upon the ground, by which his
skull was dreadfully fractured, and he died
instantly. The coach went forward on three
wheels for ten yards, and then fell over.
One of the outside passengers received a
severe internal injury, and very faint hopes
were entertained of his recovery. Another of
the outside passengers was thrown under the
coach, and had his thigh broken in two
places. He was conveyed to the Leeds
General Infirmary, and suffered the amputation
of his limb, but died in the course
of the night.</p>

<p>In August, 1828, as the Devonport Mail
was leaving London, the horses, which were
thoroughbred, took fright, and ran off at full
speed. The coachman was unable to stop
them, and in passing Market Street, the near
wheels of the coach coming in contact with
the lamp-post at the corner, the pole and
splinter-bar were broken, the horses broke
loose from the carriage, and galloped off,
dragging the pole and broken bar after them,
till the near leader rushed against the lamp-post
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
at the corner of Bury Street, the next
street to Market Street, with such force that
she broke the spine of her back.</p>

<p>Another accident occurred on the 20th. The
turnpike gate at Matterby, between Winchester
and Alresford, is placed at the foot of a hill.
The horses of the London and Poole Mail,
having become unmanageable at the top of
the hill, descended it at a furious gallop, and
came so violently in contact with the gate-post,
that the post itself was broken off and
carried to a considerable distance. One of the
wheel-horses had his brains knocked out by
the concussion, and the passengers were thrown
nearly twenty yards from the coach. One of
them was severely injured, but none were
killed. The coachman had three ribs and his
right arm broken, his eye knocked out, and
his head otherwise so bruised and cut that
blood flowed copiously from his mouth, nose,
and ears. The guard saved himself by lying
down on the footboard. The coach, notwithstanding
the shock, was not overturned.</p>

<p>Again, on the 23rd, as the Mail from
Barnstaple to Bristol had changed horses at
Wivelscombe, and the coachman was about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
to mount the box, some noise in the street
caused the horses to move down the hill.
The coachman used every effort to stop them,
till he was knocked down. They proceeded
to the bottom of the hill, and in turning a
corner the coach upset. Of three outside
passengers two were thrown with great violence
over a wall, one of them receiving
a severe contusion in the head, and the
latter having an arm broken. The third
was killed. An inside passenger had an arm
fractured.</p>

<p>In March, 1830, as the Manchester and
Huddersfield Mail was returning from the
former to the latter place, the horses broke
out into a gallop in coming down the hill near
Thornton Lodge, and became unmanageable.
On arriving at Longroyd Bridge, the mail
came violently in contact with the curbstone
and the parapet, and the coachman and three
outside passengers were precipitated over the
parapet on the rocks and gravel below, a fall
of eight or nine yards. The horses then broke
the pole and proceeded with it at a furious
rate to Huddersfield, in the streets of which
two of them fell from exhaustion, and, being
entangled in the harness, a stop was put to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the career of the other two. Of the three
passengers, one was found senseless, and died
immediately; another had a leg broken; the
coachman was much injured; the third passenger,
though his fall was four feet lower
than that of his companions in misfortune,
sustained scarcely any injury. Two other
passengers and the guard were providentially
thrown upon the road, and were but slightly
hurt.</p>

<p>In the month of September, 1836, three fatal
coach accidents occurred. On the 10th, as the
Peveril, Manchester, and London night coach
was on its way to London, and about five
miles beyond Bedford, the pole-chain got loose
and one of the horses began kicking and
plunging, and almost immediately the end of
the pole attached to the coach became unfastened.
The weight of the coach pressed
upon the horses (the coach then being at the
brow of a hill), and they had no power of
resistance. The coachman kept the horses in
the road till they reached the bottom of the
hill, when the near wheels ran upon the
grass, which was not more than four or five
inches higher than the road, and caused the
coach to overturn on the off side into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
the road. One gentleman attempted to jump
off; he fell upon his face, and the coach fell
upon him, and on the coachman. They remained
nearly a quarter of an hour in that
position, and when extricated the passenger
was quite dead, and the coachman severely
injured, one shoulder being dislocated, and
his head and body much cut and injured.
Of the male passengers four had their shoulders
dislocated.</p>

<p>In the month of February, 1807, as the
Liverpool mail coach was changing horses at
the inn at Monk's Heath, between Congleton
and Newcastle-under-Lyme, the horses which
had performed the stage from Congleton having
just been taken off, and separated, hearing Sir
Peter Warberton's foxhounds in full cry, immediately
started after them with their harness
on, and kept up the chase to the last. One
of them, a blood mare, kept the track with
the whipper-in, and gallantly followed him for
about two hours, over every leap he took,
until the fox, who was a cowardly rogue,
had led them round in a ring fence, and ran
to ground. The sportsmen who witnessed the
feats of this gallant animal were Sir Harry
Mainwaring, Messrs. Cholmondeley, Layford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Brooke, Edwin Corbett, Davenport, Townshend,
Pickford, &amp;c. These spirited horses were
led back to the inn at Monk's Heath, and
performed their stage back to Congleton the
same evening, apparently in higher spirits for
having had a gallop with the hounds.</p>

<p>Mail robberies, though not so prevalent as
in former years, existed as late as the year
1839; for in the month of June, at the Worship
Street office, information was given of a daring
attempt to rob the mail between Enfield and
Edmonton. In October of the same year a box
containing five thousand pounds in notes and
gold was stolen from the Manchester and Staffordshire
coach.</p>

<p>An extraordinary accident occurred in the
same month, when a coach was burnt on the
railway. As the "Regulator" coach, from
Bristol to London, was proceeding on one of
the uptrains to London, having a quantity of
luggage on the top, owing to the large
quantity of sparks which issued from the
chimney, the luggage took fire, a fact which
was only discovered by the coachman (who
happened, fortunately, to have remained inside)
seeing sparks of fire falling from the top of
the coach by the window. The coachman, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the hazard of his life (the train going at the
rate of forty miles an hour at the time), got
out and clambered on the roof, and by great
exertions removed the luggage from the roof,
and thereby saved the greater part; but the
brisk current of air created by the rapid speed
at which the coach was progressing rendered
all attempts to extinguish the flame unavailable
until the roof was destroyed, when, the
embers falling inside, the guard, who had come
to the coachman's assistance, succeeded in putting
out the fire.</p>

<p>In 1832 Mr. Babbage, in his work on the
"Economy of Manufactures," suggested a new
plan of conveying the mail. The immense
revenue of the Post Office would afford means
of speedier conveyance. The letter-bags do
not ordinarily weigh a hundred pounds, and
were then conveyed in bulky machines of
many thousand times the weight, drawn by
four horses, and delayed by passengers. Mr.
Babbage proposed the erection of pillars along
each line of road, these pillars to be connected
by inclined wires or iron rods, along which the
letters inclosed in cylinders attached to the rods
by rings are to slide; persons stationed on these
columns were to forward the cylinders from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
each point, after having extracted the contents
belonging to their own station. In this manner
it was calculated that a letter might be sent
(from pillar to post) to the furthest limits of
the land in the course of a very small portion
of time; from London to York, probably, in an
hour or two. In the absence of pillars, and
in the interior districts, it was suggested that
church-steeples, properly selected, might answer
the purpose, and in London the churches might
be used for the circulation of the twopenny
post. The introduction of the rail and the telegraph
has completely remedied the evil Mr.
Babbage complained of.</p>

<p>In May, 1830, much attention was excited
in the neighbourhood of Portland Place by the
appearance of a steam-carriage, which made its
way through a crowded passage, without any
perceptible impulse. There was neither smoke
nor noise; there was no external force nor
apparent directing agent; the carriage seemed
to move by its own volition, passing by horses
without giving them the least alarm. Five
gentlemen and a lady formed the passengers.
One gentleman directed the moving principle,
and another appeared to sit unconcerned behind,
but his object was ascertained to be the care of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the fuel and water. The carriage was lightly
and conveniently built, not larger nor heavier
than a phaeton. It went without the least
vibration, and preserved a balance in the most
complicated movements. The pace was varied
from five to twelve miles an hour, according to
pleasure.</p>

<p>Coaching is still the only means of conveyance
in many parts of the Australian colonies, and
in certain districts where the roads are bad, or
owing to the nature of the country, it is often
attended with considerable danger. The following
account of an accident which lately occurred
in Tasmania, taken from the "Hobart Town
Mercury," will probably be interesting to many
who have travelled by coach in days gone
by.</p>

<p>"An extraordinary accident happened to the
Falmouth mail-coach on the 10th instant, and
the passengers experienced an escape from an
awful death, which seems little short of miraculous.
After leaving the little township of
Cullenswood, the coach enters St. Mary's Pass,
noted both for its extreme beauty and for the
danger with which the journey through it is
sometimes attended. About four hundred yards
from the mouth of the pass on entering, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
road is not more than twelve feet wide. A
lofty wall of rock bounds the road on one side,
and on the other is a precipice plunging almost
sheer down to a depth of between one hundred
and fifty and two hundred feet.</p>

<p>"When Page's coach arrived at this dangerous
spot, on the day in question, a lad with
two horses happened to be coming in the opposite
direction. Instead of retreating into one
of the recesses made for the purpose, while
the coach passed, the lad persisted in going
on, and drove his horses between the vehicle
and the cliff, one of the horses backing across
the road in front of the coach, the horses in
which took fright and fell, hanging over the
precipice. With great presence of mind, the
coachman cut the harness, and the horses,
thus freed, fell through the brushwood down
to the bottom of the precipice of which we have
spoken.</p>

<p>"Fortunately for the occupants of the coach&mdash;Messrs.
Wikborg and Rattray, who were on
their way to George's Bay&mdash;the wheels caught
in a log laid on the outside edge of the road,
otherwise nothing could have prevented the coach
and passengers from following the horses in
their headlong fall, with what would almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
certainly have been a fatal result. The horses,
strange to say, were found almost uninjured,
and an attempt was made to get them up the
cliff again, but when one of the animals had
succeeded in climbing about fifty feet from the
valley, he slipped and fell to the bottom. Subsequently
a track was cut by some of the natives
of the district, and both horses were got out
safe and sound."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER X.</p>

<p>I once heard a man say that some of his
pleasantest acquaintances were people he
had picked up on stage-coaches; but I cannot
say "ditto" to that. He must either have
been singularly fortunate in his companions, or
singularly unfortunate in his general acquaintances.
A coaching acquaintance seldom&mdash;I
should imagine&mdash;never ripened into intimacy;
seldom, indeed, survived the occurrence that
produced it. Had the above authority included
stage-coachmen, to a certain degree I would
have indorsed his opinion; for, in bygone days,
I have sat beside many agreeable dragsmen;
and, from the time that the heavy coach gave
way to the fast one, there has been a wonderful
improvement in the coachmen. The driver
was formerly a man of enormous bulk, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
rubicund face, greatly addicted to strong ale,
often indulging in language the reverse of parliamentary.</p>

<p>There are so many varieties of drunkenness,
that it is difficult to define the state
the old-fashioned coachman was too often
reduced to. We hear of a man being "as
drunk as a lord;" of being "on;" of being
"muzzy;" of being "cut;" of being "two
sheets in the wind;" of having "a drop too
much;" of being "incapable." Perhaps of the
above epithets "muzzy" would be the most
appropriate, as owing to the numerous stoppages
at wayside public-houses, the coachman
had a tankard to his lips every half-hour.</p>

<p>The fast coachmen were well-conditioned, in
many instances well-educated men, who could
sing a song, and tell a good story to while
away the time. They formed a great contrast
to the old-fashioned coachmen of heavy coaches,
who were too often drunkards, as I have remarked,
and who were conspicuous for their inhumanity
in the use of the double thong and
a sort of cat-o'-nine tails called "the apprentice,"
with which they unmercifully lashed
their wheelers.</p>

<p>It was rather amusing, though mischievously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
so, to witness the consternation of the inside
passengers when some amateur on the box
"handled the ribbons." Except with a very
fast team, the coachman would turn to his companion
and say,</p>

<p>"If you have your driving-gloves on, and
would like to take the reins over the
next ten miles, you are welcome to do
so."</p>

<p>Of course the reply was in the affirmative.
If a tyro accepted the offer, it was very easy to
discover the difference between the professional
and the unprofessional, which the horses
themselves seemed to feel. They became sluggish;
not all the "gee upping" and "go
alonging," and the harmless use of the whip,
the lash of which usually got entangled in the
lamp or harness, could keep them up to their
work.</p>

<p>This was so apparent that some inside passenger
would put his head out of the window
and inquire the cause of the creeping pace they
were proceeding at.</p>

<p>"A heavy piece of road, Sir," responded the
coachman, who thought more of the guinea or
half-guinea he expected to receive than of the
loss of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
"Why, I declare," said the inquiring gentleman,
resuming his seat, "there's a young
fellow driving, and I rather think it must be his
first attempt!"</p>

<p>"Oh, let me out!" exclaims an elderly
spinster; "we shall be overturned."</p>

<p>"Disgraceful!" chimed in another. "It was
only last week that the Windsor coach met with
an accident through the reckless driving of some
inexperienced fellow."</p>

<p>"I'll report you," said an old gentleman, just
roused from his slumbers. "I paid my fare to
be driven by the proper coachman, and not by
a puppy who probably never sat behind four
horses in his life."</p>

<p>"And I'll have you dismissed, coachman, for
risking our lives," added another.</p>

<p>Then came a jerk, which caused all the insides
to break forth into the following exclamations:</p>

<p>"There, I told you!"</p>

<p>"We are going over!"</p>

<p>"Do, pray, take the reins, Mr. Coachman!"</p>

<p>In the mean time the "swell dragsman" and
his young friend were laughing heartily at the
fears of their precious burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
"Lots of fear, ma'am, but no danger," said
the former, while the latter inquired where
the coachman was going to "shoot his
rubbish."</p>

<p>When some experienced amateur took the
reins, and with the aid of the whip judiciously
applied, sent the sluggish steed along at the
rate of ten miles an hour, the scene above
described again took place, for the timid
female passenger, like the widows of Ashur,
was "loud in her wail."</p>

<p>In those days young Etonians, Harrovians,
collegians, and officers were all taught to drive
by the professional coachmen on the road, and
anyone that could manage a refractory team
over a stage or two of ten miles was deemed a
proficient, and fit to belong to the four-horse
driving club.</p>

<p>A great many aspirants for coaching honours
fancy that sitting quietly on the box, and
guiding the animals safely along the road, without
coming in contact with a post, a curb
stone, or another carriage, is all that is required;
but this is far from being the case.
To become a downright good coachman, a man
should be able to put the team together, so as
to alter a trace or bit during the journey; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
must take care that every horse does his
work, and must keep the jades up to the
collar. He must then be careful to ease his
horses up a hill, spirting down one, and taking
advantage of any level piece of road, make up
for the slower pace of a heavier one. He must
also learn how to handle his whip, so as to
flip off a horse-fly from his leaders, and to
double thong a refractory wheeler when gibbing
or refusing to work; he must remain perfectly
placid upon the box, even amidst danger never
losing his head or his temper, always remembering
that upon his presence of mind depends the
fate of his passengers.</p>

<p>Many noblemen and gentlemen there are who
can drive cleverly broken thoroughbred horses
admirably well, but who would be at a loss if
called upon to drive a stage-coach or a
"scratch" team to Epsom or Ascot. There
are, of course, many honourable exceptions,
and I select a few, and there may be others,
who could worthily fill the places of the late
"Oxford Will," Jack Adams, "Piers," "Falkner,"
"Probyn," and Parson Dennis.</p>

<p>At the head of the list I would place two
noble Plantagenets&mdash;the Duke of Beaufort and
his son, the Marquis of Worcester, who are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nulli secundus</i>; next the Earls of Sefton and
Craven, Lords Londesborough, Aveland, Carington,
Cole, and Tredegar, Colonels Tyrwhitt,
Owen Williams, the Honourable C. White, and
Armytage, Messrs. Cooper, Trotter, F. Villiers,
and H. Wombwell.</p>

<p>It may appear invidious to select the above
when there are probably many more equally good;
but I have witnessed the prowess of the above,
and speak not only from what I have myself
seen, but from what I have heard from
others.</p>

<p>There was something in the nature of a stage-coachman,
a whip of bygone days, that <em>smacked</em>
(we mean no pun) of conscious importance.
He was the elect of the road on which he
travelled, the imitated of thousands. Talk of
an absolute monarch, indeed! The monarch
even on his own highway was but a gingerbread
one to the "swell dragsman." To him
Jem the ostler rushed in servile eagerness, to
him Boniface showed the utmost deference, for
him the landlady ever had a welcome reception,
towards him the barmaid smiled and glanced
in perpetual amicability, and around him the
helpers crowded as to the service of a feudal
lord. Survey him as he bowled along the road,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
fenced in coats in Winter, or his button-hole
decorated with a rose in Summer. Listen to the
untutored melody of his voice, as he directed
the word of exhortation to his spanking tits&mdash;three
chestnuts and a grey&mdash;enforcing his
doctrine with a silver-mounted whip, the gift of
some aristocratic patron of the road, and he will
present a feature of social life in England which
no other country possessed. Hark! already he
is entering the village; the well-known horn
sounds, the leaders rattle along the road, and the
inhabitants rush out to bid him a hearty welcome.
To some he grants a familiar nod, to others a
smile of recognition, and a few only are honoured
by the warmer salutation of,</p>

<p>"Ah! how are you, old fellow? Glad
to see you. Why, you are as fresh as
paint."</p>

<p>He was regarded by all as a privileged
person, being possessed of the power to speed
the soft intercourse from soul to soul, and, at
the rate of ten miles an hour, bring the travelled
husband to the partner of his sorrow and his joy.
He could transport the lover to the feet of his
mistress; he could convey the long-absent son
to the arms of his doting parents; he could
bear the schoolboy from the scene of his tasks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
to his much-sought-for happy holiday home.
How delightful was it to behold him on a calm
Summer's evening bowling through the market
town, through the well-watered streets, with a
crew of ragged urchins, screaming and throwing
rural bouquets, culled from the hedgerows and
verdant meadows, on to the box-seat! A smile
is on every face on hearing the sound of the
horn&mdash;all run to the door to see the coach go
by; the maid-servant drops her mop in the hope
of a packet from her rustic admirer; the
youngster plays truant for a few seconds in the
anticipation of a cake from his too-indulgent
mother; the shopman quits his counter to
ascertain whether a bale of goods has been
consigned to him from the metropolis; the potboy
from the public-house holds out his rabbit-skin
cap as the guard dexterously throws the
neighbouring squire's daily newspaper into it;
the barber extends his apron for his weekly
journal; and even the parson, the pedagogue,
the lawyer, and the exciseman, the four most
influential inhabitants of the place, doff their hats
as they recognise the popular "dragsman" and
his well-appointed "turn-out."</p>

<p>With respect to his accomplishments they
were usually more select than numerous. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
speak of the professional coachman of a century
and a half ago, and not of the more gifted ones,
and amateurs who came into fashion just before
the rail drove horseflesh off the road. If the
language of the old whip had not the art of a
Sydney Smith, it had the easy style of nature,
with expletive beauties more particularly its own.
On the Shakespearean principle that "discourse
is heavy fasting," the coachman never changed
horses at a wayside public-house or inn without
fortifying his stomach with a snack. Flowing,
natural, anecdotal, and occasionally witty (garnished
with a few hearty national Attic anathemas)
was the conversation of the driver in
bygone days; while in the science of music he
was generally no mean proficient, warbling forth
"Robin Adair," "The Thorn," "The woodpecker
tapping the hollow beech-tree," and
other popular melodies of the day, to the delight
of the outside passengers.</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER XI.</p>

<p>Few, if any, of my readers will remember
the time when a turnpike-gate stood
between St. George's Hospital and Apsley
House, though many will not be unmindful
of those near the Marble Arch, Bayswater,
and Kensington, all of which were sad
nuisances to the inhabitants of the metropolis.</p>

<p>There was, however, a wide distinction
between the official in London and its suburbs,
and the rural collector. The latter was
generally an uncouth, half-sleepy clod, who,
on a moderate calculation, detained you three
minutes in procuring the ticket and change,
finally placing six or eight pennyworth of
dirty coppers and a fresh written scrap of
paper in your palm, to the detriment of clean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
hands or gloves. The suburban was generally
"wide awake" to everyone and everything.
He might be seen in his easy-chair before
the door of his contracted space&mdash;his smart,
white-painted "box"&mdash;smoking a mild havannah,
which the kindness of some sporting
passer-by had presented him with, making
remarks on passing events; and when none
occurred he would take part in a duet with
his blackbird, whose wicker cage hung by his
side, and whistle for want of thought.</p>

<p>His costume was neat; he was ever on
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui vive</i>; his mottoes were "No trust,"
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours</i> pay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toujours prêt</i>." When, like one
of Macheath's gang, he heard "the sound of
coaches," his cigar was laid aside, a ticket
taken from a neatly-arranged file, when he
exclaimed "Twopence!" then, twirling the
shilling he had received on his thumb-nail,
dived into the multitudinous pockets of his
white apron, handing out a sixpence and a
fourpenny-piece to the nobility, and tenpennyworth
of "browns" to the mobility.
And what a field he had for contemplation!</p>

<p>High life and low life, the Royal cortége,
the thoroughbred team, the barouche and four,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
the yellow post-chaise and pair, the smart
tilbury, the light dennet, the sporting dog-cart,
the heavy "bus," the gaudy van, the sable
hearse, the hackney-coach, the tilted waggon,
and the Whitechapel cart.</p>

<p>The first object that attracted his notice
might have been a ponderous, lumbering,
rickety hackney-coach&mdash;I write of the days
of the fourth George&mdash;the arms emblazoned on
the panels, showing that it had once seen
better days, a remnant of faded greatness.
The driver, too, might also have shone in the
glittering throng of St. James's on a birthday.
And oh, what a sad falling off was there!
Instead of the three-cornered hat of quaint
appearance, bedizened with gold lace and
feathers and its smart cockade, a rusty brown,
low-crowned beaver, with a wisp of straw for
a hatband. The gaudy livery had given place
to an old faded coat, bought in the purlieus of
the Seven-dials. Where are the well-curled wig,
the silken hose, the silver-buckled shoes, the
bouquet, the white gloves&mdash;where? Echo
answers, "Where?"</p>

<p>Behind this vehicle might be heard the
wheels of a tilbury, guided by an impatient
young exquisite in the extreme of fashion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
his glossy hat perched slantingly on his well-oiled,
curly hair; his tight frock coat lined
and faced with silk and velvet; the snowy
corner of a white pocket-handkerchief peeping
out of the breast pocket, perfuming the
air with the choicest scents of Arabia; the
half-blown moss-rose in his button-hole; his
boots shining in all the brilliancy of <em>day</em>&mdash;and
Martin, and his hands enveloped in light
fawn coloured kid gloves.</p>

<p>"How much?" asks the dandy.</p>

<p>"Twopence," is the reply.</p>

<p>A shilling is thrown to the turnpike
man.</p>

<p>"You may keep the change, old fellow."</p>

<p>"Quite the gentleman!" exclaims the
collector.</p>

<p>Then comes the cabriolet (now out of
fashion), on its well-balanced springs, plainly
painted&mdash;"unadorned adorned the most." See
the owner, how he prides himself on his
splendid horse and diminutive "tiger!"</p>

<p>"Now, Sir," exclaims the driver and <em>mis</em>-conductor
of a galloping "bus," with two
raw-boned bits of blood, ten outside and
thirteen in, trying to pass the cabriolet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
"Don't keep the whole of the King's
highway."</p>

<p>The unfortunate owner of the cabriolet stops
rather suddenly, and finds himself, like the
lions at the Zoological Gardens, "stirred up
with a long pole."</p>

<p>A rival "bus" approaches. "Bank! Bank!
City! Bank!" cries the conductor. The driver
makes a rush to pass both vehicles, locks his
wheel in that of the cabriolet, leaving it in
what the Americans term "a very unhandsome
fix."</p>

<p>"I hate these French himportations and
hinventions, the homnibusses!" exclaims the
gate-keeper, "they're a regular nuisance."</p>

<p>Then might be seen approaching a pony-phaeton,
with a duedecimo postilion, and a
pair of long-tailed Arabians, containing two
of England's loveliest daughters&mdash;the turnpike-man
is lost in admiration. Quickly follows the
light Whitechapel cart with a fast trotter,
"surrounding objects rendered invisible by
extreme <i>w</i>elocity," as the owner declares, who
by his bulldog and his costume shows he
belonged to the once royally-patronised prize-ring.
But see! a "drag" approaches; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
the perfection of neatness, one of Adams's<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
best&mdash;body yellow, slightly picked out with
black; under carriage black; two servants in
plain liveries behind four spicy nags&mdash;three
greys and a chestnut&mdash;each ready to leap
through his collar, put together with skill
and working beautifully. The driver is evidently
a first-rate artist, a perfect master of
the science. See how well he has his team
in hand! He is every inch a coachman. Our
turnpike-man brightens up and, doffing his
hat respectfully, exclaims,</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Adams, now Hooper, Victoria Street.</p>

<p>"Now, that's what I like to see&mdash;a gentleman
patronising the road! He's a right
regular and right honourable trump, and no
mistake!"</p>

<p>And no mistake was there, for the driver
was John Warde. A fashionable equestrian
now rides by,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"With heel insidious by the side</div>
<div class="line i0h">Provokes the caper which he seems to chide;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and a "galloping snob" of Rotten Row, since
immortalised in song, follows him. Half a
dozen spring-vans decorated with flags and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
laurels, containing men, women, and children,
barrels of beer, and baskets of provisions, are
the East-End Benevolent Society, on their road
to Bushey Park to enjoy a picnic under its
stately avenues of horse-chestnuts.</p>

<p>"It's a poor heart that never rejoices!" says
the man at the gate, smirking at the females as
he gives the ticket, and helping himself to a
handful of apples from a neighbouring barrow-woman's
stall, which he throws into the laps
of the delighted juveniles. A key bugle, playing
"Love's young dream," announces the
approach of another "drag;" but what a contrast
to the one I have described! It is painted
green, picked out with red, evidently an old
stage-coach metamorphosed; for a close observer
might perceive the words "Chatham and
Rochester," partly defaced, and painted over
with a fancy crest and motto; the driver sitting,
like a journeyman tailor on his board, with one
servant behind, with a gaudy livery and gold-laced
hat; the horses, one blind, two kickers
and a bolter, evidently bent on having a way of
their own. "Regular Brummagem," exclaims
the man of "no trust." "All is not gold that
glitters."</p>

<p>Next comes a youth on an animal long in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
neck and high in the bone, accoutred with a
pair of saddle-bags, his twanging horn announcing
him to be the suburban postman,
the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i7h">                  "Herald of a noisy world;</div>
<div class="line">News from all nations lumbering at his back."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The hand of the clock is on the stroke of four,
and, although no carriage is within sight, the
collector is at his post, change and ticket in
hand; within a few seconds a phaeton, with
"harnessed meteors" flashes through the gate.
The words "ticket," "all right," have passed
more quickly than I can write them. That is the
carriage of some gentleman who possesses a villa
at Richmond, and whose avocations call him to
town twice a week.</p>

<p>"That's a regular gentleman," says the pike;
"quite a timekeeper, no need of a watch the
day he passes, and he always stands a turkey
at Christmas."</p>

<p>Next comes a hearse with numerous mourning-coaches,
returning from all the pride and
pomp of a funeral pageant. What a contrast
now to the last time the procession passed the
gate! Then the tears of a widowed wife, the
sobs of a bereaved daughter, might be heard;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
now all is vulgar mirth and uproarious merriment;
the trappings of woe, the plumes, the
"inky cloaks," the customary suits of solemn
black, are a perfect mockery of grief.</p>

<p>Turn we to a brighter theme. An advanced
guard of a crack Lancer regiment announces
the approach of the Royal cortége. The acclamations
that rend the sky herald the approach
of the "observed of all observers," the luxurious
George IV., then in the height of his
popularity. Such was the turnpike gate in
bygone days.</p>

<p>Few sights were more amusing than the
"White Horse Cellar," Piccadilly, in the old
times of coaching. What a confusion&mdash;what a
Babel of tongues! The tumult, the noise, was
worthy the pen of a Boz, or the pencil of Cruikshank.
People hurrying hither and thither,
some who had come too soon, others too late.
There were carriages, hackney-coaches, vans,
carts, and barrows; porters jostling, touters
swearing, cads elbowing, coachmen wrangling,
passengers grumbling, men pushing, women
scolding. Trunks, portmanteaus, hat-boxes,
band-boxes, strewed the pavement; orange
merchants, cigar merchants, umbrella merchants,
dog merchants, sponge merchants, proclaiming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the superiority of their various wares;
pocket-knives with ten blades, a cork-screw,
button-hook, punch, picker, lancet, gimlet, gun-screw,
and a saw; trouser-straps, four pairs a
shilling; silver watch-guards&mdash;"cheap, cheap,
very cheap;" patent pens and (n)ever-pointed
pencils, twelve a shilling; bandana handkerchiefs,
that had never seen foreign parts, to be
given away for an old hat; London sparrows,
as the coachmakers would say, "yellow bodies,"
were passed off as canaries, though "their wood
notes wild" had never been heard out of the
sound of Bow Bells; ill-shaven curs, "shaven
and shorn," and looking like the priest in the
child's story, "all forlorn," painted, powdered,
and decked with blue ribbons, assumed the
form of French poodles who "did everything
but speak;" members of the Society for the
Diffusion of Knowledge were hawking literature
at the lowest rate imaginable&mdash;"H'annuals at
the small charge of one shilling; the h'engraings,
to h'any h'amateur, worth double the
money;" the "Prophetic Almanack" neatly
bound, one penny; "a yard and a half of songs
for a half-penny;" and "Larks in London,"
pictorially illustrated, for one shilling.</p>

<p>The remainder of the group consisting of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
perambulating piemen, coachmen out of place,
country clods, town cads&mdash;gaping, talking, wondering;
the din occasionally interrupted by a
street serenade, the trampling of cattle, or the
music of a guard's horn. In our day, the
interesting sight of some well-appointed coach
drawn up before the old "White Horse Cellar"
may still be witnessed, divested of the noise and
confusion of former times. The coachman&mdash;generally
speaking a gentleman&mdash;quietly takes
his seat on the box, the guard is attentive to
the inside and outside passengers, and at the
"All ready!" cheers the lookers-on with the
sound of his horn; while the four spicy nags
trot along Piccadilly at a steady pace, to be
increased when they get off the stones.</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER XII.</p>

<p>Having dwelt at considerable length upon
stage coaches and stage coachmen, I now
turn to amateurs who have distinguished themselves
on the box, and who were perfectly
competent to take the reins in the event of an
accident to the regular driver. Here I am
reminded that upon one occasion, when Bramble
was driving the Chichester coach to London,
and was prevented completing the journey from
an accident, the present Duke of Richmond,
then Earl of March, took his place, and landed
his passengers safe and sound at the "White
Horse Cellar," Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Among gentlemen coachmen of bygone times
may be mentioned the late Lords Clonmel and
Sefton, Sir Charles Bamfylde, Sir Lawrence
Palk, Sir John Rogers, Sir Felix Agar, Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Bellingham Graham, Sir Henry Parnell, Sir
Thomas Mostyn, Sir John Lade, Sir Henry
Peyton, the Honourable Fitzroy Stanhope, the
Honourable Charles Finch, the Honourable
Thomas Kenyon, Messrs. T. R. and J. Walker,
Maddox, Warde (the father of the field and road),
Charles Buxton, Henry Villebois, Okeover,
Annesley, Harrison, of Shelswell, and last, not
least, "Tommy Onslow," immortalised in the
well-known lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"What can Tommy Onslow do?</div>
<div class="line i0h">He can drive a phaeton and two.</div>
<div class="line i0h">Can Tommy Onslow do no more?</div>
<div class="line i0h">Yes; he can drive a phaeton and four."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At a later period we have had the Dukes of
Beaufort, the Marquis of Waterford, the Earls
of Chesterfield, Londesborough, Waldegrave,
Sefton, and Rosslyn; Lords Alfred Paget, Alford,
Rivers, Worcester, Macdonald, Powerscourt,
Colonel Copeland, Sir St. Vincent Cotton, Sir
E. Smythe, George Payne, Esq., H. Villebois,
Esq., Prince Batthyany, A. W. Hervey
Aston, Esq., J. Angerstein, Esq., and T. Barnard,
Esq.</p>

<p>And here I am reminded of one who, as an
amateur coachman and vocalist, was second to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
none. I allude to the late Honourable Fitzroy
Stanhope, than whom a kinder-hearted creature
never existed. Few men had seen more of the
world in all its phases than poor Stanhope; but
under whatever circumstances you met him,
whether at the social board, on the racecourse,
on the box of a "drag," in the snuggery of the
Garrick Club, or in the shooting-field, he was
ever the high-bred gentleman. His nerve and
head when on the box were wonderfully good.
I well recollect sitting behind him on the late
Hervey Aston's coach at Ascot races, when the
owner, who was rather short-sighted, drove his
leaders against some very strong ropes that
surrounded the booths; and, as the team was
very skittish, we must have come to grief had
not Fitzroy, in the coolest manner, helped us
out of the scrape by catching hold of the reins.
This he did in a most quiet and good-humoured
manner, and with so much
tact that Aston was pleased instead of being
offended.</p>

<p>"You are an excellent coachman," said
Stanhope, "but a little too venturesome; there,
take the ribbons again, no one handles them
better."</p>

<p>The above was the second escape from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
accident that befell us that day. In driving out
of the Knightsbridge Barracks, Aston managed
to get his leaders and wheelers huddled together,
and, the salute of the sentry at the
gate frightening them, the wheel came in contact
with the post and the pole snapped in two.
Fortunately, assistance was at hand, and the
only ill result was a delay of some twenty
minutes. I was on the box at the time; and,
thinking probably other difficulties might arise
on the road, I urged Fitzroy Stanhope to change
places. Stanhope's vocal powers were of the
first-rate order, as all will bear testimony who
listened to his merry and musical voice when he
carolled forth "The Swell Dragsman," "The
Bonny Owl," "The days that we got tipsy in,
a long time ago," and other convivial songs.
Poor Fitzroy! his loss was deeply felt by a large
circle of friends.</p>

<p>And here let me place before my readers a
description of the four-in-hand club of 1808.
This club was in the habit of meeting once or
twice a month in London, and then proceeding
some fifteen or twenty miles into the country
to dine, returning at night. It was called the
"Driving Club," and the carriages turned out in
the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Sir Henry Peyton's barouche-landau, four
bays.</p>

<p>Mr. Annesley's barouche-landau, four roans,
thoroughbred.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephen Glynn's barouche-landau, four
bays.</p>

<p>Mr. Villebois's barouche-landau, four bays.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitmore's barouche-landau, four bays.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Conver's barouche-landau, four bays.</p>

<p>Mr. Pierrepoint's barouche-landau, four bays.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Mostyn's barouche-landau, four
bays.</p>

<p>Lord Foley's barouche-landau, four bays.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Warde's barouche-landau, four
bays.</p>

<p>"After dining at Bedford," so writes a
chronicler of that day, "they dashed home in a
style of speed and splendour equal to the spirit
and judgment displayed by the noble, honourable,
and respective drivers."</p>

<p>Another club, called the "Whip Club," in
rivalship with the above, met once a month in
Park Lane, and proceeded thence to dine at
Harrow-on-the-Hill. There were fifteen barouche-landaus,
with four horses; Lord Hawke, the
Honourable Lincoln Stanhope, and Mr. Buxton
were among the leaders. Lincoln Stanhope was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
one of the most popular men of the day. He
was never known to say an unkind word, never
known to do an unkind action. Peace be with
him! for he was one in whom the soldier, the
courtier, and the man of honour were so
happily blended that, when a few of his remaining
compatriots shall have passed away, I fear
we may long search the fashionable throng in
vain to find another.</p>

<p>The following was the style of the sets-out of
the Whip Club:&mdash;Yellow-bodied carriages, with
whip springs and dickey boxes; cattle of a bright
bay colour, with silver-plate ornaments on the
harness and rosettes to the ears. The costume
of the drivers consisted of a light drab-coloured
cloth coat, made full, single-breasted, with three
tiers of pockets, the skirts reaching to the
ankles, a mother o'pearl button of the size of a
crown piece; waistcoat blue and yellow stripe,
each stripe an inch in depth; small clothes
corded silk plush, made to button over the
calf of the leg, with sixteen strings, and rosettes
to each knee; the boots very short, and finished
with very broad straps, which hung over the
tops and down to the ankle; a hat three inches
and a half deep in the crown only, and the same
depth in the brim; each wore a large bouquet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
of flowers at the breast, resembling the coachmen
of the nobility on a drawing-room or levee
day. The popular song of the Whip Club
ran as follows, I only remember the first
verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"With spirits gay we mount the box, the tits up to the traces,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Our elbows squared, our wrists turned down, dash off at awful paces;</div>
<div class="line i0h">With Buxton bit, bridoon so trim, three chestnuts and a grey&mdash;</div>
<div class="line i0h">Well coupled up the wheelers then&mdash;Ya, hip! we bowl away."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Many most distinguished men have in our
day not thought it derogatory to their dignity
to work a public stage-coach, and among them
may be mentioned the Marquis of Worcester,
father to the present Duke of Beaufort, on the
"Evening's Amusement;" and most delightful
"amusement" it was to pass an "evening" by
the side of the noble Plantagenet. Then there
were the Earl of Harborough, on the "Monarch,"
Sir St. Vincent Cotton, Bart., the ex-10th
Hussar, and Charles Jones, Esq., on "The
Age;" the Honourable Francis Stafford Jerningham,
on the "Day Mail," Sackville Gwynne,
on the "Beaufort;" John Willan, Esq., on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
"Early Times;" and young Musgrave, on the
"Union," all of whom "fretted their hour upon
the stage." One very great improvement has
taken place in the dress of amateur coachmen,
whose costume is as different in our day from that
of the time when George the Third was king,
as the brilliant gas in our streets is from the oily
rays that rendered darkness visible in the
metropolis.</p>

<p>So outrée was the costume of amateur coachmen
early in the present century that it gave
rise to innumerable squibs and caricatures.
One squib, embodied in a popular song, ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">  "On Epsom Downs</div>
<div class="line i1">  Says Billy, 'Zounds!</div>
<div class="line">That cannot be Lord Jackey.</div>
<div class="line i1">  Egad, but now</div>
<div class="line i1">  I see it is,</div>
<div class="line">I took him for his lackey.'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, Charles Mathews as Dick Cypher in
the farce of "Hit or Miss" caricatured the dress
so well that he gave offence to many of the
noble whips.</p>

<p>Grimaldi, the inimitable Joe Grimaldi, also
introduced in a Christmas pantomime a scene in
which both coaches and coachmen were ridiculed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Out of a light-coloured Witney blanket he made
himself a box-coat reaching down to his ankles,
small plates formed the buttons, a bunch of
cabbages the bouquet in the button-hole; a low,
white-crowned hat, purloined from "Mr. Felt,
hatter," formed his head-dress; boots with
paper tops, from "Mr. Last, shoemaker,"
adorned his legs, to which were attached some
ribbons he abstracted from a lady's bonnet;
while the carriage which he drove triumphantly
across the stage was composed of a child's wicker
cradle, with Gloucester cheeses from a butter-man's
for wheels, his whip a fishing-rod with
a lash attached to it, and four spotted wooden
horses, which (before the march of intellect
furnished amusing books for the young)
formed the stud of childhood, completed the
whole.</p>

<p>Seated on a high stool in the above vehicle,
his elbows squared, and with the usual number
of "ge ups!" "go along!" he convulsed the
audience with laughter. What a contrast there
is between the dress of the present day and that
above recorded! Gentlemen no longer ape
the manners or costumes of their coachmen
and grooms, but appear as gentlemen should
appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
The heavy box-coat is discarded in Summer
for the light-coloured dust-coat; the hat is no
longer preposterously low; a neat, cutaway
olive brown or blue coat, with club buttons,
supersedes the over-pocketed drab coat; well-cut
trousers from Poole's, with varnished boots,
take the place of the cord "inexpressibles" and
brown tops; the striped, livery-looking waistcoat
and gaudy, "bird's-eye" neckcloth are
replaced by a plain waistcoat and simple necktie.</p>

<p>Then the improvement in coaches, horses, and
harness! The "drags" are not now of showy
colours, emblazoned with arms like the Lord
Mayor's state carriage; the horses are thoroughbred
and fine steppers, the harness neat and
plain. Ladies need no longer scramble up to
the box-seat or roof to the detriment of their
dresses, small iron ladders being made to fix
on the sides, while an amateur player on the
cornet-à-piston or horn enlivens the journey with
a concord of sweet sounds.</p>

<p>At this present moment there are two coaching
clubs&mdash;the Coaching Club and the Four-in-Hand
Club.</p>

<p>Among the members of the above clubs may
be mentioned the following distinguished names:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER XIII.</p>

<p>In the days I write of driving was a favourite
pursuit, and, independent of the four-in-hand
clubs, every young fellow aspired to
handle the ribbons whenever a chance threw
a drive in his way. The Oxford and Cambridge
men were first-rate dragsmen, and many
a reverend who may now devote his leisure
to "coaching" youths for college or the Army
was then "coaching" very different teams.
There were some first-rate "turns-out" on the
Oxford road. Never shall I forget an adventure
that occurred to me on the box of the
far-famed "Tantivy."</p>

<p>We had just entered the University from
Woodstock, when suddenly the horses started
off at an awful pace. What made matters
worse was that we saw at a distance some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
men employed in removing a large tree that
had fallen during the storm of the previous
night across the road near St. John's College.
The coachman shook his head, looking very
nervous, while the guard, a most powerful
man, stood up to be prepared for any
emergency.</p>

<p>On we went, the coachman trying in vain
to check the galloping steeds, and we had
got within a few yards of the critical spot,
when the guard, crawling over the roof,
managed somehow or other to get on the
footboard, when, with a spring, he threw
himself on the back of the near wheeler, and
with a giant's grasp checked the horses at
the very moment the leaders were about to
charge the tree.</p>

<p>Down they came, but the guard never
yielded an inch, and, with the assistance of
the country people nearest at hand the
leaders regained their legs without the slightest
damage to man, horse, coach, or harness. A
subscription for our gallant preserver was got
up on the spot.</p>

<p>The coachmen of well-appointed "drags" were
a privileged class, they were familiar, "but by no
means vulgar," and were universal favourites
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
with all who came in contact with them; Stevenson,
the high-bred University man, who, if
not, up to "coaching" young graduates for
college honours, easily won his "great go"
on the box; Parson Dennis, who drove the
"White Lion" coach to Bath, knew more
of modern than biblical Jehus; Black Will,
who drove the Oxford "Defiance," rather
ferocious in appearance, but gentle by nature
as a lamb. Others, too, I might mention, if
memory served me, who raised themselves to
the highest pinnacle of fame as civil, obliging,
and intelligent men.</p>

<p>Having already given the doings of others
on the road, I shall now proceed to record
my own, hoping that I may be forgiven for
indulging in that offensive of all offensive
pronouns&mdash;I.</p>

<p>"The root of all learning," writes Aristotle,
"is bitter, but the fruit is sweet," an
apothegm which will particularly apply to
driving.</p>

<p>I well remember, when I was at a private
tutor's, at Littlewick-green, Maidenhead Thicket,
and subsequently at Donnington-grove, near
Newbury, and a bit of a swell, being greatly
smitten with the saying of the above learned philosopher.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
I never got into a buggy, handled
the ribbons, rattled the hired horse along at
a crack-skull pace of twelve miles an hour,
which generally ended in an upset, without
reflecting on the above quoted authority which,
being interpreted, means it is wormwood to
be immersed in a wet ditch, but pleasant
enough to get out again.</p>

<p>Poor defunct Jem Revell, of the "Pelican,"
Newbury, was my tutor. Under his auspices
I first mounted the box of a tandem, learned
the elegant and indispensable accomplishment
of driving that most dangerous vehicle, and
studied the appalling man&oelig;uvre of turning
out of a narrow inn-yard into a densely
populated street. Every day, after hours devoted
to study, was my drive repeated, until
in process of time inexperience was conquered,
and, "with elbows squared, and wrists turned
down," I could catch hold of the wheeler
and leader, in grand style&mdash;remembering with
Horace that "sæpe <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stylum</i> vertas," and give
the go-by to less dashing whips, with a most
condescending nod.</p>

<p>At last, after serving a long and tedious
apprenticeship, I reached the long-expected
haven of success, and set up a dog-cart and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
pair on my own account. Never shall I
forget that proud hour of my triumph when
I made my first public essay out of the
yard of the "Pelican," on my road to
Reading races. I was accompanied by about
five or six of my comrades on horseback,
and by one or two aspiring Dennets, the
drivers of which vainly essayed to beat my
two thoroughbred nags.</p>

<p>As we entered the town, for a young
"chum" of mine, now long since gathered
to his ancestors, sat by my side, the streets
were lined with an infinite assemblage of
peers and peasants, squires and blacklegs, sporting
men and bettors, horse-dealers, jockeys,
grooms, trainers, and cardsellers.</p>

<p>However much it may tell against me&mdash;however
greatly I may lower myself in the
estimation of the reader&mdash;truth compels me
to admit that my aspiring vanity metamorphosed
the gaping crowd into admirers of
myself and my turn-out; and when my
companion sounded the mail-horn, when I
cracked my whip and shook my head knowingly&mdash;well,
<i>there was not much in that</i>, as a
cynic will remark&mdash;I, with "all my blushing
honours thick around me," felt as proud as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
any peacock that ever strutted in a poultry-yard.</p>

<p>But, alas for human greatness! my pride
was doomed to have a fall. Just as we
approached the "Bear Inn" the leader
became restive, turned round and stared
me in the face, a mode of salutation by no
means agreeable; then he began to lash out, and
finally succeeded in upsetting us and breaking
the shafts. Happily, we escaped unhurt in
body, though not in feeling.</p>

<p>In thus alluding to scenes of juvenile folly,
I cannot forget that I once was young, and
that there are still many (among them my only
son, now studying farming at Her Majesty's
Royal Norfolk Farm, Windsor Great Park), with
others at private tutors' and college, equally
devoted to the box as I was. To them I would
offer a few suggestions respecting tandem-driving,
which of all vehicles is the most difficult
to manage.</p>

<p>Its height from the ground and peculiar
lightness of construction renders it, at first
sight, a very formidable machine; and the only
way to prevent disaster is for the driver to
obtain a firm grasp of the reins before he ventures
to cheer his tits, and to ascertain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
amount of work which wheeler and leader do,
so that the traces may be gently tightened&mdash;a
proof that both animals are doing their duty.
In returning home at night there is no instinct
like that of the horse; he seems to acquire mind
by the departure of light, and to succeed best
when man is most ready to despair.</p>

<p>I have trotted a tandem from London to
Windsor, at twelve o'clock at night, in the
midst of the darkest and most tremendous thunderstorm
I ever witnessed, with little chance of
safety but what I owed to the docility of my
horses. This is an instinct which, like that of
the prophet's ass, should not be balked; and
so firmly am I convinced of the superior intelligence
of the quadruped to the biped, in cases
of similar difficulty, that I would actually give
up my own fancy to let him have his head, and
make the best he can of it. In going down
hill, there is one very necessary caution to be
observed to which I must now refer.</p>

<p>The mode of harnessing a tandem differs
from that most usually adopted in a four-in-hand;
so that if your leader is a faster trotter
than your wheeler, he draws the collar over
the neck of the shaft-horse, and a partial strangulation
not unfrequently occurs. To prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
this, keep your wheeler at his full pace, slackening
in the meantime the extra speed of your
leader. The above is necessary at all times&mdash;doubly
so when going down hill. Whenever
you stop to bait, never omit to remain in the
stable, unless you have a most trustworthy
groom, during the time of feeding. Depend
upon it, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">haud inexpertus loquor</i>. There are
modern ostlers, of course, with many honourable
exceptions, who are not unlike the coachmen
satirised by the author of "High Life
Below Stairs:"</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"If your good master on you dotes,</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Ne'er leave his horse to serve a stranger;</div>
<div class="line i0h">But pocket hay, and straw, and oats,</div>
<div class="line i1h">  And let the horses eat the manger."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The oat-stealer, as he has not inappropriately
been named, of the present day, will, we fear,
in too many cases, follow the example of the
unprincipled fraternity above referred to. Independent
of this necessary caution, there is
surely a feeling of gratitude due to the poor
dumb brutes who have toiled all day in our
service; and young dragsmen will do well to
remember that humanity to defenceless animals
is the strongest characteristic of the British
sportsman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Through the introduction of the rail, a great
saving has been effected, both as regards time
and inn bills. Some of the "old school" still,
as far as is feasible, stick to the road; but
declining accommodation must diminish their
numbers every day. Nothing is now so forlorn
as a great, rambling, half aired, half appointed
country inn; waiter acting boots, boots acting
postboy, or, may be, all three; and cook acting
chambermaid, barmaid, and all. The extinction
of the old posting-houses is, perhaps, the only
thing connected with the establishment of railways
I lament.</p>

<p>There certainly was a nice, fresh, cool
country air about the old roadside inns that
was particularly grateful and refreshing on
a fine evening after emerging from the
roasting and stewing of a long London season.
The twining roses, the sweet-scented jasmine,
the fragrant honeysuckle, the bright evergreens,
the flowers and fruit in the trim gardens; above
all, the real rich country cream, fresh butter,
and new-laid eggs. These&mdash;the inns&mdash;are now
mere matter of history; and the Irishman who
travelled with his eggs "because he liked them
fresh" is no longer a subject of ridicule. Moreover,
these inns were often prettily situated&mdash;some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
by the side of gliding rivers, others near
rushing dams, or overlooking ancient bridges,
or commanding views over extensive ranges of
rich country scenery&mdash;very honeymoonish sort
of places some of them were: witness the
"White Hart," Cranford Bridge; the "Castle,"
at Salt-hill; the "Salutation," Ambleside; the
"White Horse," Haslemere; the "Talbot,"
Ripley; the "Saracen's Head," Beaconsfield;
"Royal Oak," Ivy Bridge; the "Bush," at
Staines; "White Lion," Hartford Bridge, Hants;
the "Swan," at Chertsey; the "Castle," Speen
Hill; "Sugar-Loaf," Dunstable; and last, not
least, the "Saracen's Head," Dunmow, suggestive
of "The Flitch of Bacon" and the duties
of matrimony&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"To fools a torment, but a lasting boon</div>
<div class="line i0h">To those who wisely keep their honeymoon."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Happily a few are still kept for happy couples
on their wedding tour. The bill was generally
the only disagreeable feature about these rural
caravansaries; and some of the innkeepers were
uncommonly exorbitant. Nevertheless, the
majority of the victims were in a favourable
mood for imposition. Going to London, they
had all the bright prospect of a season's gaiety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
before them, and under that impression people&mdash;wise
people at least&mdash;were inclined to give the
reins of the purse a little license, and not criticise
charges too severely.</p>

<p>Happy is the man who can pass through life
in this easy, reins-on-the-neck sort of way, not
suffering a slight imposition to mar the general
pleasure of his journey!</p>

<p>Returning from the metropolis, the country
innkeeper had the advantage of having his bill
contrasted with a London one&mdash;an ordeal that
none but a real land shark would wish to shrink
from. A comparison of inn charges throughout
England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, for
the same style of entertainment, would be curious
if not instructive. They would show (what,
however, almost every other line of life shows)
that one often pays double for nearly the same
thing by going to different places for it. Take
a bottle of soda-water, for instance. Walk into
a large, fashionable hotel, and desire the waiter
to bring you one. You drink it, and
ask,</p>

<p>"What's to pay?"</p>

<p>"A shilling, if you please, Sir," (or ninepence&mdash;which
is the same thing), waiters at
large hotels never having any coppers. If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
were to go to the next chemist's you would
get it for fourpence&mdash;very likely of the same
quality. But the great impositions were, after
all, the charges for wax-lights and breakfasts.</p>

<p>Gas has now superseded the former, but
breakfasts were and are still charged too high.
"Breakfast, with eggs and bacon, three shillings
and sixpence," was and is the charge at
fashionable hotels; at less pretentious ones you
may get the same for two shillings, or at most
half-a-crown.</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER XIV.</p>

<p>Among the amateur knights of the whip of
bygone days, though still remembered by
many of the present generation, may be mentioned
the late Duke of Beaufort, the Earls of
Chesterfield and Harborough, Lords Poltimore,
Grantley, and Suffield, Colonel the Honourable
Lincoln Stanhope, the Honourable Fitzroy
Stanhope, Sir St. Vincent Cotton, Sir Henry
Peyton, Captains Angerstein and Tollemache.</p>

<p>The head of the Somerset family was a very
steady dragsman, and knew his business well.
He was a less showy coachman than Lord
Chesterfield; but his Grace had the qualification
of making each horse do his quantum of
work.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield, had he possessed a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
more steadiness, would have been scarcely inferior
to Stevenson, of the Brighton "Age;"
but his exuberant, buoyant spirits ran away
with him sometimes; he would lark, and the
"old gentleman" himself could not have stopped
him. His drag was as well appointed as the
Duke's, and looked coaching all over, without a
spice of slang, the prevailing error of many
amateurs of that day.</p>

<p>Lord Harborough gave the tyros a hint touching
the stamp of horses befitting the occasion.
He always drove a good sort himself, and
eschewed the long tails; and, but for a little
infirmity of temper occasionally, he put his team
along in very good form. No man can excel on
the box who is not gifted with good temper and
patience; for not only his comfort, but his life
and the necks of his friends depend upon the
above qualities. Horses have as many whims
and caprices as their drivers have; they entertain
likes and dislikes, in imitation of their
owners; and a little attention to the temper
and disposition of this useful quadruped is as
necessary as any part of the supervision of the
stable.</p>

<p>Lord Poltimore's team of roans were always
up to the mark, and were such fast steppers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
that any one of them might justly have been
termed the <i>rapid Rhone</i>. His Lordship had the
smartness and quickness so essential in a thoroughly
good dragsman.</p>

<p>Four such horses as Lord Grantley's were
never put together in the days I write of&mdash;they
were in every sense of the word matchless.
They were purchased at four years old in Yorkshire,
and stood nearly seventeen hands high,
the colour Arabian grey, with black manes
and tails. This was the only admissible case
of switch tails; the size and figure of those
splendid animals were a sufficient reason for
their not being docked. The drag was not a
drag, it was an old tub of a family carriage,
unworthy the beautiful horses his Lordship
drove.</p>

<p>Lord Suffield was the quickest and smartest
coachman I ever sat on the box with, and never
shall I forget a journey I took with him to
Newmarket to attend the July Meeting. We
started from "Grillon's Hotel" in Albemarle
Street, where his Lordship resided, with four
as nice cattle as ever the lover of driving could
wish to sit behind; but upon reaching the first
stage I found, to my dismay, that we were to
proceed with posters for the rest of the journey.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
The team came forth from the yard, and were
with some difficulty put to, for the near-side
wheel, a mare, was somewhat cantankerous;
there was a lurking devil in her eye which foreboded
mischief. She took an exception, in the
first place, to the pole pieces, and would not be
coupled up; this, however, after a little dodging,
leaning, and squealing, was achieved, and then
came the start&mdash;or, rather, I should say the
time for starting; not an inch, however, would
she budge. She planted her fore feet at a
most resisting angle in front of her, and there
she stuck; the united forces of the leaders and
her collaborateur, the offside wheeler, were insufficient
to move her. Coaxing, persuasion,
and all sorts of soothing arts were lavished on
her in vain; and as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suaviter in modo</i> failed
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fortiter in re</i> was tried, and with a better
result, for after shoving, thumping, and double
thonging, she suddenly bolted into her collar
and started off at an awful pace. Suffield kept
her head straight, though for miles nothing could
stop her.</p>

<p>At last the nonsense was taken out of her,
and we reached our destination in safety. The
mare, as may be imagined, was in no very
enviable plight; she shook from head to foot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
but we afterwards heard that the lesson she
had received was not thrown away, and
that she ever after took kindly to her
work.</p>

<p>Colonel Lincoln Stanhope had a good team,
but he was not a first-rate whip. His brother
Fitzroy was incomparably one of the best gentlemen-coachmen
in England. Many an aspirant
to four-in-hand celebrity was indebted to him
for the knowledge in driving they possessed;
and many a friend's life was saved by
his presence of mind, coolness, courage, and
skill, as I have already said.</p>

<p>Sir St. Vincent Cotton was a first-rate
coachman; and, although he must be ranked
among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus irritabile</i>, he possessed great
coolness, which he invariably exercised when
occasion required it. His horses got away
with him more than once, as I can vouch for;
but I know not the man with whom I would
sooner be seated on the box under such trying
circumstances. His strength of arm was prodigious;
and, although not quite so showy or
graceful a whip as some of his compeers, he was
a steady and safe one.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Peyton was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nulli secundus</i>: he
belonged to the old school; his team
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
was always the same, and his horses were
of the right sort&mdash;large ones in a small
compass.</p>

<p>Captain Angerstein's turn-out was exceedingly
neat, but his horses never had a fair chance,
as he was continually changing them; and
Captain Tollemache was first rate as an
amateur whip. Many others are equally
worthy of honourable mention, but I have confined
myself to those I have sat beside on the
box.</p>

<p>A fashion has lately sprung up amongst us,
or rather, I should say, been adopted (for it is
of American origin), and that is the almost total
abolition of the bearing-rein. Much has been
said, written, and argued pro and con.; some
assert, and with truth, that, generally speaking,
it is less safe, for as the best and soundest horse
may once in twelve months make a mistake,
the advocates for the loose rein cannot help to
admit that a bearing-rein must assist the horse
to recover himself under such circumstances.
All extremes are bad, and no one would wish to
torture an animal's mouth by pulling his head
into an unnatural position, like a dromedary,
with an excruciatingly tight bearing-rein; but,
on the other hand, the absence of one is open to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
objection. Some horses may, and do, carry
themselves so well that a bearing-rein appears
superfluous; but, nevertheless, it may be useful,
and for this reason should never be entirely
dispensed with. I do not say that exceptions
may not be permitted. Those possessed of
thoroughbred horses, endowed with superior
action, may indulge in any whim or caprice
they like; and animals worth from four hundred
guineas to six hundred guineas apiece, and
which go with their heads up, of course do not
require a bearing-rein, but I condemn the
principle for universal adoption; and I have
heard the opinions of some of the best coachmen
of the day, both amateurs and professionals,
who have asserted that for the generality
of horses the practice is a dangerous one.
Some animals' heads are put on differently
from others, and consequently they vary in their
mode of carrying them. Some, for instance,
are star-gazers and appear to be taking lunar
observations, while others poke their heads
forward in such a longitudinal form that they
resemble in this particular the Continental
swine trained for grubbing truffles. The plan I
should like to see adopted would be to have a
bearing-rein with an elastic end to it, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
horses that did not require having their heads
held well up would not be deprived of the ornament
of such a rein, and even with horses
that did require it, if the elastic was pretty
strong, it would aid them in case of a trip or
stumble.</p>

<p>In former days it was the custom to drive
with wheel-reins home&mdash;that is, short to the
hand; this was decidedly objectionable, especially
in hilly counties; and, with groggy wheel-horses,
not unattended with danger, for an
awkward blunder might pull you from the box.
The running-rein is now universally adopted,
and in skilful hands is immeasurably superior
to the old system. This is observable in the
best-appointed fast coaches, of which there are
happily still a few left, as well as private
carriages.</p>

<p>The harness of the present day is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ne
plus ultra</i> of good taste: it is infinitely lighter
than formerly, although equally strong, and
the less a horse is encumbered the better.
Look how superlatively neat are the traces of the
coaching clubs; they are narrow, but the strength
lies in the thickness, and the collars fit to a
nicety. The four-in-hand clubs have set a
laudable example; they have produced emulation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
and emulation produces good horses.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cuique sua voluptas</i>&mdash;which, I believe, literally
construed, means "every hog to his own apple;"
and, delightful as driving a private drag is&mdash;for
it pleases the ladies, and all goes "merry as
a marriage bell" in an excursion to Richmond,
Greenwich, Maidenhead, the Crystal or Alexandra
Palaces&mdash;it, perhaps, was exceeded by
the pleasure of sitting on the box-seat of one
of the Royal mails, with four fresh horses
every eight miles, and a guard decked out
in regal livery behind to whisper in your ear
if you did not keep your time. The night-mail
was very preferable to a day coach&mdash;first,
because you seldom met any seedy old fellows
outside the mail enveloped in stuff cloaks, with
cotton umbrellas, which on a rainy day acted
as a spout to convey the water down your
neck, and who, on seeing the coachman give
up the ribbons would instanter bawl out.</p>

<p>"I say, coachman, I can't allow that."</p>

<p>Then the pace on the mail was always
good. Again, the mail was not encumbered
with huge piles of massive black boxes,
fantastically worked with brass nails, belonging
to the lady passenger inside; and last, not
least, there was a sort of glorious autocratical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
independence when you felt that every vehicle
on the road made way for the Royal mail.</p>

<p>There is no circumstance of greater importance,
as tending to the pleasure and facility
with which horses are driven, than that of
putting them well together; this, of course,
applies to a four-horse team. By this term
the due regulation of the harness and the
most appropriate place for each horse are
implied. If properly attended to, it is wonderful
the ease with which four horses may be
driven, compared with the effort&mdash;in some
cases risk&mdash;consequent upon an injudicious
and unskilful disposition of the appointments.
With regard to the team, a little extra power
in the wheel-horses is desirable, inasmuch as
they have a greater portion of labour to perform
in holding back the vehicle down hill;
while the high-couraged and free-goers will
be most advantageously driven as leaders.
Practice alone will render a man a proficient
in driving four horses.</p>

<p>To explain the proper mode of handling
"the ribbons," except by actual example, is not
an easy task; and the attempt to give hints
from which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</i> of a good coachman&mdash;hands&mdash;are
to be acquired, is still more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
difficult. A few general remarks may, however,
not be out of place.</p>

<p>The position of the hand and arm has much
to do with appearance, and a vast deal more
with the art of driving. The left hand should
be carried nearly parallel with the elbow, covering
about one third of the body: in that position
it is ready for the immediate aid of the
right whenever the two are required, which in
bearing to the right or left of the road, or in turning,
is generally the case, as likewise in shortening
the hold of the reins.</p>

<p>The right hand should at all times be kept
as free as possible, so as to be able to make
a judicious use of the whip when required.
A good mouth is essential to comfort and
safety; it enables a horse to be guided simply
by a turn of the wrist. Many a good mouth,
however, has been spoilt by the heavy, dead
pull of an inexperienced driver. The greatest
care, then, should be taken not to irritate or
suddenly check the animal, but by a certain
yielding of the hands (the reins being divided
in each), enable him to drop his head and
play with the bit.</p>

<p>The experienced driver may easily be recognised
from the novice the moment he approaches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
the vehicle he is about to ascend. He invariably
casts his scrutinising eye over his
horses, his harness, and his carriage, and, if
the least thing be out of place, detects it in
an instant; nay, more, he will assist in putting
to the horses; and, if I required an illustration
of what I have asserted, I should find it in
the person of the Duke of Beaufort, who, at
the sale of Sir Thomas Barrett Lennard's
hunters, last October, before mounting the box,
aided in putting the team together, and, when
his Grace ascertained that all was right, started
off in a manner that would have gratified the
heart of Sir Henry Peyton had he been alive
to witness it.</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER XV.</p>

<p>Among the "wild vicissitudes of taste,"
few things have undergone greater changes
than carriages used for pleasure; we need not
go further back than the last half century to
prove what we have said. Formerly there was
the lumbering heavy family coach, emblazoned
with coats of arms, with a most gaudy-coloured
hammer-cloth, and harness resplendent with
brass or silver work. Then there was the neat,
light travelling postchaise, and the britzska&mdash;the
latter imported from Germany&mdash;for those
who posted on the roads; together with the
graceful curricle, in which the gallant Anglesey
and the arbiter of fashion, Count Alfred
d'Orsay, were wont to disport themselves in
the park; the four-horse "drag," the unpretending
"tilbury," the rural-looking "dennet,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
the sporting mail-coach phaeton, the vis-à-vis,
and the cabriolet, a French invention, which
was introduced into England after the campaign
in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Of the above few remain. Royalty and
some of the leading aristocrats alone patronise
coaches. Travelling-carriages, tilburies, dennets,
curricles, vis-à-vis, cabriolets, are things of the
past, and all that remain to us are town-chariots,
"drags," and mail-phaetons, in addition
to which we have "broughams," "victorias,"
waggonettes, and a few private Hansom
cabs.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be believed that, some five-and-forty
years ago, almost every nobleman and
gentleman used the cabriolet, "slightly altered
from the French" (as the playbills say), to
convey him to dinner, balls, and parties; for
example, the late Duke of Wellington, when
Ambassador to the newly-restored monarch,
Louis XVIII., in 1814-15, seldom, except on
state occasions, made use of any other vehicle,
the carriages being devoted to the service of
the Duchess. This I can vouch for, for at
that period I was attached to his Grace's staff,
and was always in the habit of driving him
when occupied in paying visits in the morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
or of attending dinners and parties in the
evening.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget one evening, at Paris,
when driving my chief in his cabriolet from
the Hôtel Borghese to the Théâtre Français,
I very nearly upset the vehicle; and, as the
accident occurred in a very crowded street, it
might have been attended with serious consequences.
It was an eventful day in my life;
and, to explain my distraction on that occasion,
I must enter at some length into the cause
of it. This I do most readily, as the whole
transaction reflects so much credit on the
Duke's kindness of heart.</p>

<p>One morning, late in December, the curricle
was at the door, and I, equipped for the chase,
was waiting to drive Wellington in his curricle
to Versailles, the place where the Royal stag-hounds
were to meet, when he sent for me. I
found him busy over some papers.</p>

<p>"I shall not be able to go to-day," said he,
"but you can have the curricle. Tell the Duke
de Berri I have some letters to write, as the
messenger starts for England at two o'clock,
which will prevent my meeting His Royal Highness.
Elmore is sent on for me; and, as he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
short of work, you had better ride him. Don't
knock him about."</p>

<p>I briefly expressed my thanks, and started for
the rendezvous, where I delivered my message,
and mounted the far-famed hunter, Elmore,
recently purchased in England for the Duke at
a high price. From the manner in which he
carried me (at that time a very light weight)
many of the field were anxious to possess him;
indeed, it was hinted to me that the Duke
could command almost any sum for him.</p>

<p>A party of young men headed by Count
d'Orsay, afterwards so well known in London,
proposed a steeplechase home for a sweepstakes
of one Napoleon each, which, had Elmore been
my own property, I should have gladly entered
him for; but I remembered the Duke's injunction
and declined.</p>

<p>Delighted with the character the new purchase
had obtained, I started to ride quietly
home by myself, when, within half a league of
Paris, in crossing a small grip, I found that
my horse went lame. To dismount and inspect
his foot was the work of a moment, but I could
see nothing. No alternative was then left me
but to lead the limping animal home, which
I did amidst the taunts and jeers of the rabble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
No sooner had I reached the stables than I
sent for the head-groom and the Duke's state
coachman, to whom I explained all that had
occurred.</p>

<p>"Well, you have gone and done it," said the
latter, who was a most eccentric character.
"We wouldn't have taken three hundred
guineas for that horse."</p>

<p>This knight of the ribbons, be it remarked,
always spoke in the plural number, and talked
of what <em>we</em> had done in the Peninsula,
of <em>our</em> triumphal entry into Madrid, and
of how <em>we</em> had beaten Ney and all the French
marshals.</p>

<p>Happily for me the Duke, who had been
occupied all day, was out riding, and I did not
see him until we met at dinner. I had fully
made up my mind to tell him of the accident
before going to bed, but waited until I received
a further account of the horse's state.</p>

<p>As a large party was assembled, little was
said about the hunt until the ladies left the
room, when I was called upon to give an account
of the run, which I did. I then mentioned
the brilliant manner in which Elmore had
carried me, and the panegyrics he had received
from all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
"A splendid animal," said Wellington, "I
hope to ride him next Monday at Fontainebleau."</p>

<p>My heart quailed within me. The hours
glided on, and when driving the Duke to the
theatre that evening in his cabriolet, so distracted
was I that I grazed the curbstone, and
was within an inch of knocking over one
of the gendarmes as we approached the
theatre.</p>

<p>It was late when we arrived; the last scene
of "Orestes" was going on, with Talma as
the hero; then followed the inimitable Mademoiselle
Mars in "La Jeunesse de Henri Cinq,"
from which the English version of "Charles the
Second" has been adapted.</p>

<p>To account for the change of monarchs, and
to explain the inconsistency of having the wicked
Earl of Rochester, the companion of "Sweet
Prince Hal," I may remark that when the drama
was first about to be brought out in Paris,
during the reign of Napoleon I., the licenser
objected to Charles, he being a restored Monarch,
so the author had no alternative left him but
to rewrite the whole piece or change his hero.
The latter course he adopted, trusting that a
Parisian audience would not detect the anachronism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
The perfect acting of Talma had no charm
for me, and when the after-piece began I was
too wretched to laugh at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhomie</i> of the
actor who represented Captain Copp, or to appreciate
the archness of that child of nature,
Mlle. Mars as Betty.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the theatre I became so thoroughly
distracted that I scarcely knew what I was
about; unluckily a young horse, who was a
little skittish, had on that evening taken the
place of the one that I had been in the habit of
driving, and, as there was an unusual crowd in
the streets, extra care was necessary.</p>

<p>"With great difficulty I threaded my way through
carriages of all descriptions, and was approaching
the Rue de Rivoli when I heard a clattering
of horses' hoofs behind me and the cheers of
some hundreds of people assembled near the
entrance to the Palace of the Tuileries.</p>

<p>"It is the King returning from the Louvre,
where His Majesty has been dining with the Duke
d'Orléans," said my companion.</p>

<p>At that moment my thoughts were entirely
engrossed with Elmore, and I was rehearsing to
myself how I should break the untoward news
of the accident to the Duke. So, instead of
pulling the left rein to enable the royal cortége
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
and the cavalry escort to pass me, I pulled the
right one, and very nearly brought my chief to
grief. Happily, however, at this moment the
only damage done was to the leg of a mounted
police officer, who soundly rated me in language
unfit to be repeated.</p>

<p>Misfortunes they say never come singly; we
had not proceeded many yards, when a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamin</i>,
who had evidently a taste for pyrotechnic exhibitions,
let off a cracker, which so frightened the
animal I was driving that he bolted across the
street, came in contact with a lamp-post, and
as near as possible upset the cabriolet. What
made it appear worse was that the escort above
referred to was returning at a brisk trot to their
barracks, and, had we been overturned, the
Duke might, for the first time in his military
career, have been trampled upon by French
cavalry.</p>

<p>"Lucky escape!" was the only remark Wellington
made, and as the danger to which I had
exposed him had completely roused me from my
lethargy, I at once "screwed my courage to the
sticking place" and told the whole of my day's
adventures with the hounds.</p>

<p>"Can't be helped," said he, in his usual quick
manner; "accidents will happen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Upon the following morning my worst fears
were realised; Elmore was dead lame; and when
I reported this to his Grace, his only answer
was,</p>

<p>"I cannot afford to run the chance of losing
my best horses; so, in future, you shall have
the brown horse and the chestnut mare, and
if you knock them up you must mount yourself."</p>

<p>In a previous chapter I have referred to a
carriage accident that occurred to Wellington
when I was with him; and it is somewhat
strange that I should again be by his side, and
in a great measure the cause of a second misfortune.</p>

<p>I own myself that I regret cabriolets are no
longer the fashion. For a man that can afford
to keep a number of carriages, a victoria and
brougham are all very well; but the former is
only available in fine weather, whereas a cabriolet
with a projecting head could defy most showers
of rain. A well-appointed cabriolet was a comfortable
and gentleman-like conveyance, and,
for the bachelor, did the duty of a close carriage
at half the expense. A perfect cabriolet
horse, however, costs money, and the equipage
must be well turned out. A seedy-looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
cabriolet and horse to match are abominations
not to be endured.</p>

<p>I have said that a cabriolet should be well
"got up;" and in order to do this the owner
must possess two horses&mdash;one for daylight,
and another for night work; a clever "screw"
will answer for the latter purpose&mdash;one, however,
that can go the pace, although he can
never show until the gas is lit. No one who
values a good horse would dream of allowing
him to stand exposed to chilly blasts at the
opera, the theatre, or his club.</p>

<p>At no period were carriages better constructed
or more neatly turned out than they are in
the present day, both as regards vehicles, harness,
and horses. At the same time, without
being hypercritical, I think some changes might
be made for the better. Let me instance the
following:&mdash;A coachman's curly wig seems
quite out of character when we consider the
costume of the day, and it certainly might be
dispensed with. Again, a light victoria or
brougham are often to be seen with a pair of
horses to each, whereas one fine stepper would
be preferable; then (happily only in a few-instances)
the case is reversed, and a carriage,
open or shut, meant for two horses, has only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
one. Again in the present day, with some
exceptions, noblemen and gentlemen do not
keep to their old family colours; and occasionally
we see a brougham black picked out with
blue, and a chariot of quite a different colour.
Nothing looked better than the Russell brown
and blue, the Rutland and Sefton light yellow,
the Hamilton red, the Foley reddish brown,
the Harrington dark brown, the Anglesey
dark yellow, more especially when the carriages
were drawn by splendid horses.</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER XVI.</p>

<p>In addition to the splendid turns-out of the
members of the Coaching and Four-in-Hand
Club, every cavalry regiment and many infantry
corps possess a regimental "drag," which is
always well horsed and usually well driven.
During the time I served in the army such a
thing was unknown, and the only opportunities
officers had of driving were when travelling
by stage-coach, or when a tandem was improvised
in the barrack-yard.</p>

<p>Many a hairbreadth escape have I had from
one of these breakneck vehicles. When at a
private tutor's at Donnington, I and a young
companion&mdash;alas! now no more&mdash;hired a tandem
from Botham, of the "Pelican," Newbury,
to take us to Reading. Safely should we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
arrived there but for a drove of oxen which
met us on our way. The result was the
accident related in a previous chapter, and my
ankle was dislocated.</p>

<p>My next attempt was when I was on the
Staff of the Duke of Wellington, at Cambrai.
Frederick Yates, then in the Commissariat
Department, afterwards lessee of the Adelphi
Theatre, was anxious, like myself, to visit an
amateur performance by the officers stationed
at Valenciennes; and it was arranged that we
should drive over in my dennet, to which he
was to add a leader.</p>

<p>All went well until we approached the plains
of Denain, when a man leading a dancing bear
so frightened our steeds that they set off at a
gallop, overturning us in a dry ditch. Unfortunately
for me, the handle of my sword, which
I had stowed away in front of the apron, came
in contact with my body and broke a rib; so,
instead of enjoying my visit, I was laid up for
a week at a not over-comfortable hotel. This
was my second and last appearance in a tandem,
and I strongly recommend those who value
their limbs never to trust themselves to such
a conveyance. In earlier days I have driven
four horses many hundred miles on the road
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
and through the crowded streets of the metropolis,
and never once came to grief.</p>

<p>Let me now refer to the use of wheel carriages
in towns, which is not of very ancient
date among the English people. During the
reign of James I. the drivers of both public and
private carriages had no other accommodation
than a bar, or driver's chair, placed very low
behind the horses; in the following reign they
rode postilion fashion.</p>

<p>After the Restoration they appeared with whip
and spurs, and towards the end of the century
mounted a coachman's box. This box, covered
with a hammer-cloth, was in reality a box, and
within it, or in a leather pouch attached to it,
were tools for mending broken wheels or
shivered panels, in the event of accidents occurring,
which were by no means uncommon; in
consequence, first, of the defective construction
of the vehicles, which, according to Davenant,
were "uneasily hung, and so narrow that he
took them for sedans on wheels;" in the
second place, from the clumsy driving of carmen
in the crowded thoroughfares; and, lastly and
principally, from the nature of the streets themselves,
full of all the worst perils a coachman
could have to encounter. The state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
the street ways, where the ruts lay half a
yard deep, did not admit of rapid driving, and
we read, even in the days of Charles II., of the
Royal coach being upset twice in getting from the
City to Westminster.</p>

<p>At this date, and for some generations after,
the custom was, when ladies traversed the city
in carriages, for the gentlemen gallants to accompany
them on horseback, riding in advance, or
on each side. These formed a body-guard, not
at all unnecessary or superfluous, looking to the
swarms of "scourers," "knights of the road,"
and "goshawks" who made free warren of
London streets and scrupled at no act of
violence. The picture Gay has left us of the
street ways in the beginning of the eighteenth
century will form some estimate of what they
were at an earlier period:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
The first hirable vehicles in London were the
hackney-coaches, so called not from the village
of Hackney, as commonly supposed, but from
the old word "to hack," or let on hire. The
first hackney-coaches were stout-built vehicles,
fitted for the rough roads of the time; they
made their appearance originally in 1625, and
were kept at certain inns, where they had to be
sent for when wanted, and these were only at
this time twenty in number.</p>

<p>In a proclamation issued by Charles I., in
1635, the King prohibited the general and
promiscuous use of hackney-coaches in London,
Westminster, and their suburbs, as being "not
only a great disturbance to His Majesty, his
dearest consort the Queen, the nobility, and
others of place and degree, but the streets were
so pestered and the pavements broken up
that the common passage was thereby
hindered." It was therefore commanded that "no
hired coaches should be used in London
except to travel three miles out of the
same."</p>

<p>Two years after the foregoing prohibition the
King granted a licence for fifty hackney-coachmen
in and about London and Westminster, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
keep twelve horses each. This licence was extended
to other cities and towns. In course of
time the increase of street carriages called forth
the indignation of Taylor the water-poet. What
would that renowned king of scullers, whose
wonted boast was that he had often ferried
Shakspeare from Whitehall to Paris Garden, and
Ben Jonson from Bankside to the Rose and
Hope playhouses, have said had he lived in the
present days? Probably the poor water rhymer
would have drowned himself in his own element,
or at least would have drowned his cares in
a more spirited mixture. What a fearful picture
did he draw of the calamity that assailed his
trade!</p>

<p>"We poor watermen have not the least cause
to complain against any conveyance that belongs
to persons of worth or quality, but only against
the caterpillar swarm of hirelings. They have
undone my poor trade, whereof I am a member.
This swarm of trade spoilers, like grasshoppers
or caterpillars of Egypt, have so overrun the
land that we can get no living on the water;
for every day, if the Court be at Whitehall,
they do rob us of our livings, and carry five
hundred and sixty fares daily from us. I pray
you but note the streets and the chambers or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
lodgings in Fleet Street or the Strand, how
they are pestered with coaches, especially after
a masque or play at Court, where even the
very earth shakes and trembles, the casements
shatter, totter, patter, and clatter, and such
a confused noise is made that a man can neither
sleep, speak, hear, write, nor eat his dinner
or supper quiet for them; besides, their tumbling
din, like counterfeit thunder, doth sour wine,
beer, and ale, almost abominally, to the impairing
of their healths that drink it, and the
making of many a victualler's trade fallen."</p>

<p>In a publication entitled "The Thief," Taylor
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Carroches, coaches, jades, and Flanders mares,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Do rob us of our shares, our wants, our fares;</div>
<div class="line i0h">Against the ground we stand, and knock our heels</div>
<div class="line i0h">Whilst all our profit runs away on wheels."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The London shopkeepers, too, bitterly complained.</p>

<p>"Formerly," they said, "when ladies and
gentlemen walked in the streets there was a
chance of obtaining customers to inspect and
purchase our commodities; but now they whisk
past in the coaches before our apprentices have
time to cry out 'What d'ye lack?'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Taylor above referred to, does not appear to
have entertained a very high opinion of the
tradesmen of his day, for he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"When Queen Elizabeth came to the crowne,</div>
<div class="line i0h">A coach in England then was scarcely knowne.</div>
<div class="line i0h">Then 'twas as rare to see one as to spye</div>
<div class="line i0h">A tradesman that had never told a lie."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hackney-coaches were admitted into Hyde
Park before the year 1694, but were expelled
at that period, through the singular circumstance
of some persons of distinction having been insulted
by several women in masks; riding there
in that description of vehicle.</p>

<p>In 1728, the robberies were so frequent in
the streets of London, Westminster, and parts
adjacent, that Lord Townshend issued a notice
offering a reward of £40 "for each felon convict
returned from transportation before the expiration
of the term for which he or she was
transported, who shall, by the means of such
discovery, be brought to condign punishment."
It appears by the above, that the murders,
beatings, and robberies were perpetrated in a
great degree by returned convicts, Hackney-coaches
being their special mark, as the following
paragraph which appeared in the "Postman"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
of the 19th of October, 1728, will
prove:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The persons authorised by Government to
employ men to drive hackney-coaches, have
made great complaints for want of trade, occasioned
by the increase of street robbers; so
that people, especially in an evening, choose
rather to walk than to ride in a coach, on
account that they are in a readier posture to
defend themselves, or call out for help if
attacked. Meantime, it is apparent that, whereas
a figure for driving of an hackney-coach
used lately to be sold for about £60, besides
paying the usual duties to the Commissioners
for licensing, they are at this time, for the
reasons aforesaid, sold for £3 per figure
goodwill."</p>

<p>The conveyance now known as the omnibus
was borrowed from our Continental neighbours,
for it was in existence in France two centuries
ago. Its rise and progress may not prove uninteresting.
Carriages on hire had long been
established in Paris, and were let out by the day
or hour from the sign of St. Fiacre.</p>

<p>In 1662 a Royal decree of Louis XIV.
authorised the establishment of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carrosse à cinq
sous</i>, got by a company, with the Duke de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Rohan and two other noblemen at the head of
it. The decree stated that these conveyances,
of which there were originally seven, built to
carry eight persons, should run at fixed hours,
full or empty, to and from the extreme parts
of Paris; the object being to convey those who
could not afford to hire carriages.</p>

<p>The public inauguration of the new vehicles
took place on the 18th of March, 1662, and
was attended with much state. Three of the
coaches started from the Porte St. Antoine, and
four from the Luxembourg. Previous to their
setting out, the principal legal functionary addressed
the drivers, pointing out to them their
duties to the public. After this harangue, the
procession started, escorted by cavalry, the
infantry lined the streets to keep them
clear.</p>

<p>Writers disagree as to the reception these
conveyances met with. Sauval, in his Antiquities
of Paris, affirms that the populace
hooted the drivers and broke the windows of
the carriages with stones; while, on the other
hand, Madame Perrier, sister to Pascal, describes
the joy with which these "twopenny-halfpenny
busses" were received.</p>

<p>It appears, too, that the King took a trip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
in one at St. Germain, and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce de circonstance</i>
was got up at the Théâtre Marais, entitled
"L'Intrigue des Carrosses à Cinq Sous." Strange
to say, when the fashionable Parisians ceased
to patronise the omnibus, it went completely
out of favour, as the poorer class declined to
travel in it. Hence the company failed.</p>

<p>In 1827 a society entitled "Entreprise Générale
des Omnibus" again introduced the system,
which was thus alluded to in the newspapers
of 1829:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The omnibus is a long coach, carrying
fifteen or eighteen people, all inside. Of these
carriages there were about half-a-dozen some
months ago, and they have been augmented
since; their profits are said to have repaid the
outlay within the first year; the proprietors,
among whom is M. Lafitte, the banker, are
making a large revenue out of Parisian sous,
and speculation is still alive."</p>

<p>During the struggle of the three days in
July, 1830, the accidental upsetting of one
of these vehicles suggested an idea that
barricades could be formed out of a number
of them; and this plan was tried and followed
out.</p>

<p>Shortly after the introduction of the omnibus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
in Paris, a public-spirited individual started
two of these carriages in London, which ran
from the Bank of England to the Yorkshire
Stingo, in the New-road, and were called
"Shillibeers," after the introducer. Each of
these vehicles carried twenty-two passengers
inside, with only the driver and conductor
outside; each omnibus was drawn by three
horses, abreast, and the fare was one shilling
for the whole distance, and sixpence for half.
Since that time the fares have been considerably
lowered, and outside passengers are
taken.</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER XVII.</p>

<p>An adventure which occurred to me some fifty
years ago may not here be out of place. I
was dining one day with Ball Hughes, commonly,
from his wealth, called "The Golden
Ball," when the conversation turned upon
Paris.</p>

<p>"What say you to going there?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I should like it much," I replied.</p>

<p>"Send for Guy," continued he, addressing
the butler; "and help yourself to
claret, we shall not have much time to
spare."</p>

<p>Before I could express my surprise, Guy, the
coachman, entered the room.</p>

<p>"Have the travelling-chariot with the four
bays round in half-an-hour, and send the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
seats and imperial into my room to be packed.
By the way," he proceeded, turning to me, "you
will want some one to go and tell your servant
to bring your clothes, we shall return in a
week."</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest?" I inquired, somewhat
taken aback at this hasty movement.</p>

<p>"Quite," he answered; "pass the bottle;
and, John, take the small front imperial to
Lord William's lodgings in Pall Mall, tell his
servant to pack it up, and we will call for it
on our way."</p>

<p>In half-an-hour the carriage was at the
door; we took our seats, the faithful valet
ascended the rumble, and the order was
given,</p>

<p>"Make the best of your way to Dartford,
call as you go by at No. 4, Pall
Mall."</p>

<p>It was a lovely evening in July, and despite
of having all the windows down we felt
greatly oppressed with heat.</p>

<p>"What say you to riding?" inquired my
companion; "pull up, boys."</p>

<p>"I am not in trim for riding," I replied,
"with these thin white trousers, shoes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
silk stockings; my legs will be awfully
chafed."</p>

<p>"Never mind, my good fellow, we will go
as slow as you please, and you shall have
your choice, short or long traces."</p>

<p>The postilions had alighted, and, having
borrowed their whips, we exchanged places,
and in less time than I can describe it the
Golden Ball was mounted on a high-stepping
thoroughbred leader, while I was piloting two
as handsome wheelers as ever trotted their
twelve miles an hour.</p>

<p>No event worthy of record occurred upon the
road. It is true that the pole occasionally reminded
my brother postilion that the traces
were slack, that we grazed a carrier's cart
upon entering Deptford, that we frightened an
itinerant vendor of apples and pears as we
dashed over Blackheath, and, finally, that
we upset a one-horse chaise standing in the
High Street of the town identified with Pigou
and gunpowder.</p>

<p>As we drove up to the door of the "Bull
Inn" we found, to our great horror, a crowd
assembled in front of it.</p>

<p>"Pull up!" I bellowed at the top of my
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
"I can't," responded my friend.</p>

<p>"Then turn in down the yard. Take a
good sweep, or we shall upset the carriage."</p>

<p>We did turn in with no greater damage
than carrying away a wooden post, breaking
a lamp, rubbing a piece of skin off the
near leader, and tearing his rider's Hessian
boot.</p>

<p>A cheer was then heard from the assembled
crowd. We jumped off our horses, gave them
up to the two postilions, who had hastily descended
from the carriage, and made our way
to the entrance, where the landlord, landlady,
waiter, and ostler stood, looking as much astonished
as the inhabitants of Edmonton did
when Johnny Gilpin made his appearance in that
town. Unfortunately Cowper was not with us
to immortalise our adventure.</p>

<p>"Can we have four horses immediately?"
asked Ball Hughes, in his blandest manner.</p>

<p>"The packet starts early for Calais."</p>

<p>"First and second turn out!" shouted the
ostler, while mine host could scarcely repress a
smile.</p>

<p>An <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclaircissement</i> took place when it appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
that Queen Caroline, the ill-fated wife
of the Fourth George, had been expected; that
some Dartford Paul Pry had caught a view of
the gold embroidered velvet jackets and caps
of the postilions, and had given the signal for
the cheers, mistaking the inmates of the carriage
for at least Lord Hood in his Chamberlain's
dress, Sir Matthew Wood in his Aldermanic
gown, or Her Majesty herself decked out in
Royal attire. Finding we could not reach Dover
in time for the boat to Calais we stopped for
the night at the "Rose," Sittingbourne.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the French omnibus;
and it may not be here out of place to record
an instance of the light-heartedness of our Continental
neighbours, who instead of erasing a
most painful episode in the history of their
country from their minds, appear to perpetuate
it, as will be seen by the following statement
extracted from one of their own
journals:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Parisian Omnibus Company has preserved
a curious relic of the late Commune in
the shape of an omnibus which the Communists
used for one of their barricades, and which was
riddled through the street fights between the
Versailles troops and the insurgents by as many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
as eight hundred shots or bomb-shell splinters.
The coachman's box is broken, and only one
wheel hangs on to the vehicle."</p>

<p>I have now given the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agrémens</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">désagrémens</i>
of coaching, and have come to the conclusion
that all unprejudiced persons would prefer the
rail to the road, especially those to whom time
and money are objects. A man may now breakfast
in London and dine in Dublin, and this
journey can be performed at (as compared with
former charges) a very considerable reduction.</p>

<p>Pullman's cars, now confined to the Midland,
and partly to the Brighton line, will soon become
universal. Then a night journey will be free
from exertion, and after a good night's rest the
traveller will find himself some hundred miles
from the place of departure. Those, too, who
indulge in "sublime tobacco," whether in the
shape of a meerschaum, brier, clay pipe, a
mild Havannah cigar, or a Latakia cigarette,
can smoke in a covered carriage, instead as of
old on the outside of a mail coach, amidst a
pelting, pitiless storm. However, as tastes
differ, there will always be a certain number
of old stagers who, denouncing steam, will talk
with rapture of the palmy days of the road, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
of their delight when they went "coaching, a
long time ago."</p>

<p>Railways were originally formed altogether
of timber, and it was not until 1767 that the
first experiment was tried, and that upon a very
small scale, to determine the advantage of substituting
iron for the less durable material.
Nor does it appear that this experiment was
successful, or followed by any practical result,
for in 1797 Mr. Carr claimed to be considered
the inventor of cast-iron rails.</p>

<p>The railways which were constructed up to
the beginning of 1800 were all private undertakings,
and each was confined to the use of the
establishment&mdash;generally a colliery&mdash;in which it
was employed. The public railways of the United
Kingdom are strictly creations of the present
century. Here I may remark that as early as
the year 1216 the idea of applying the power
of steam to locomotion first suggested itself.
Roger Bacon, a Franciscan friar, who flourished
during the reign of Henry III., foretold that
ships would some day move without sails, and
carriages without horses; and though his
scientific researches were not duly appreciated
in his own times, he may fairly take rank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
with the greatest pioneers of modern discovery.</p>

<p>In the days of Charles II., Edward Somerset,
Earl of Glamorgan and Marquis of Worcester,
invented and constructed the first steam-engine.
His title to this honour has been the subject of
dispute, some historians attributing to him a
greater share of merit than there was sufficient
evidence to warrant, while others deprive him
of even that honour to which he possesses an
indefeasible claim. Possessing inventive genius
of the highest order, he was considered a mad
enthusiast, because his speculations were advanced
so far before the age in which he lived,
and he has been set down as a quack and
impostor by men incapable of comprehending
the nature or appreciating the value of his
creations.</p>

<p>The slow march of knowledge and of time
has at last revealed the worth and established
the character of an illustrious and unfortunate
man of genius, who only lived to complete
his mighty design and carry it happily into
effect. Macaulay thus refers to the Marquis of
Worcester:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Marquis had observed the expansive
power of moisture rarefied by heat. After many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
experiments, he had succeeded in constructing
a rude steam-engine, which he called
a fire-waterwork, and which he pronounced to
be an admirable and most forcible instrument of
propulsion."</p>

<p>But the Marquis was suspected to be a madman,
and known to be a Papist, his inventions
therefore found no favourable reception. His
fire-waterwork might, perhaps, furnish matter
for conversation at a meeting of the Royal
Society, but was not applied to any practical
purpose.</p>

<p>The next engine was invented by Captain
Savery, in 1698, for the purpose of raising
water by the help of fire. Newcomen came next,
followed by James Watt.</p>

<p>And here I must pay a passing tribute to the
inventive genius and wonderful discoveries of
James Watt, to whom, perhaps, more than to
any other man, the world is indebted for the
beneficial results which have flown from the development
of steam power.</p>

<p>Some six hundred years after Roger Bacon's
prophecy, another prophet arose. In 1804, so
writes a popular author, "George Stephenson
was a poor labourer, his son Robert lying in his
cradle; then the stage-coach dragged along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
its weary course at about five miles an hour, and
a letter posted in London would reach Edinburgh
<i>perhaps</i> in a week. In 1824 the father said
to the son:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tell you what I think, my lad. You
will live to see the day, though I may not,
when railroads will supersede all other modes of
conveyance; when mail coaches will go by railway,
and railways become the great highway
for the King and his subjects. The time
is coming when it will be cheaper for a working
man to travel by railway than to walk on
foot."</p>

<p>A bold, a daring, but a great social and
patriotic prediction: both father and son lived
to see it fulfilled. These wonderful changes
have been brought about through the perseverance
of a quintuple alliance&mdash;the Stephensons,
Brunels, and Locke&mdash;of each of whom it may
be said, if you seek his monument, "Look not at
the place of his birth, his abode, or his death,
but survey his works throughout the greater part
of the habitable globe."</p>

<p>In 1824 the first locomotive constructed by
George Stephenson travelled at the rate of six
miles an hour; in 1829 the "Rocket" travelled
at the rate of fifteen miles an hour, and obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
the prize of five hundred pounds offered by
the directors of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway Company for the best locomotive.</p>

<p>In 1834 the "Firefly" attained a speed of
twenty miles an hour; and at the present
moment locomotives have increased their speed
to over sixty miles an hour. Merciless ridicule
attended the introduction of railway travelling;
and in reference to a proposed line
between London and Woolwich, a writer in
the "Quarterly Review" not only backed "Old
Father Thames" against it for any sum, but
assured his readers that the people of Woolwich
"would as soon suffer themselves to be
fired off upon one of Congreve's ricochet
rockets as trust themselves to the mercy of
such a machine&mdash;a high-pressure engine, and
going at the rate of eighteen miles an
hour."</p>

<p>The reviewer adds that he trusts Parliament
will limit the speed of railways to eight or nine
miles an hour, which is as great as can be
ventured upon with safety. Despite this prediction,
the rail, as we all know, has proved
a perfect success.</p>

<p>When railways were first proposed, in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
to prove to Parliament that they would pay,
persons called "traffic takers" were placed
at the entrance of large towns to note down
the traffic in and out of the town. When
the Brighton and South Coast line was before
the House of Commons, and evidence was
given as to the existing traffic, the counsel
for the company suggested that they might
be allowed fairly to say that this would be
doubled, when increased means of travelling
were afforded. This seems ludicrous now,
when probably one train of passengers and
one of goods carries considerably more than
the above estimate.</p>

<p>Many ineffectual attempts have been made to
introduce steam-carriages on the roads, and in
1822 Mr. (afterwards Sir) Goldsworthy Gurney&mdash;inventor
of the steam-jet, emphatically called
by engineers "the life and soul of locomotion"&mdash;constructed
a carriage for that purpose. To
show that it was capable of ascending and descending
hills, of maintaining a uniformity of
speed over long distances and on different kinds
of roads, a journey was undertaken from Hounslow
Barracks to Bath and back. On arriving
at Melksham, where a fair was being held, the
people made an attack upon the steam-carriage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
wounding the stoker and the engineer
severely on their heads from a volley of stones.
The return journey was more satisfactory, as
the whole distance (eighty-four miles), stoppages
for fire and water included, was travelled over
in nine hours and twenty minutes, the carriage
at one time increasing its speed to twenty miles
an hour. The Duke of Wellington and his staff
met the carriage at Hounslow Barracks, and
were drawn in his Grace's barouche by the
steam-engine into the town.</p>

<p>From February to June, 1831, steam-carriages
ran between Gloucester and Cheltenham
regularly four times a day, during which time
they carried nearly three thousand persons and
travelled nearly four thousand miles, without
a single accident. Every obstacle, however, was
thrown in the way of this new invention; large
heaps of stones were laid across the road
eighteen inches deep, under the pretence of
repairing the highway; and on an Act of Parliament
being passed which imposed prohibitory
tolls on turnpike trusts, the steam-carriage was
driven off the road.</p>

<p>On the journey to Bath above referred to,
the toll for the steam-carriage was six guineas
each time of passing. About this period Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Sir James Viney patronised a Mr. Pocock and
the making of kites for the purpose of drawing
a carriage, but these paper horses were ungovernable,
particularly in a storm, and Sir
John gave them up for a couple of ponies,
which, in truth, were almost as wayward.</p>

<p>One conveyance alone remains to which I
have not referred&mdash;the sedan chair, named after
the town of Sedan, in France. In early days
I well remember a very gorgeous specimen of
the above, emblazoned with the family arms,
which used to convey my mother to evening
parties; and as late as the year 1834 I have
often, at Leamington, Edinburgh, and Bath,
made use of a sedan chair to take me to
dinner. One advantage this conveyance had
over a carriage was that, upon a snowy or rainy
night, you could enter it under cover and get
out of it in your Amphitryon's hall. Occasionally
it was used by young spendthrifts against
whom writs were out, as it enabled them to
avoid the sheriff's officers. It was not always,
however, a safe refuge, as Hogarth, in one
of his prints, represents a tipstaff seizing hold of
some debtor he was in search of.</p>

<p>Early in the present century a very clever
caricature appeared, in which an Irishman was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
seen wending his way through dirt and slush,
his legs and feet obtruding from a sedan chair&mdash;some
waggish practical joker (the Theodore
Hook of that day) having removed the bottom
of it. Two stout chairmen, aware of the trick
that had been played upon their inside passenger,
are selecting the dirtiest streets, or
most flinty part of the road, while the unfortunate
Emeralder exclaims:</p>

<p>"Bedad! if it was not for the honour of the
thing, I would as lief walk."</p>

<p>The costume of the chairmen at Bath was
very peculiar: they wore long, light-blue coats
highly ornamented with buttons about the size
of a crown piece, the skirts of which reached
down to their ankles; short "inexpressibles,"
white cotton stockings, shoes with buckles,
and a huge cocked hat bound with gold lace.
They were fine, powerful men, with calves to
their legs which would have made the fortune
of any fashionable footman. "When sedan-chairs
were first introduced, a great feud arose between
the chairmen and the hackney-coachmen, which
led to many serious disturbances. The contest
was carried on with the greatest bitterness;
and the hatred it engendered was equal to that
of the Montagues and Capulets, the Guelphs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and the Ghibellines, the Red and White Roses;
eventually, through the interference of the law,
peace was restored.</p>

<p>Wilson thus refers to the sedan-chair named
after Sedan on the Meuse. In his Life of
James I., this passage, in speaking of the Earl
of Northumberland, occurs: "The stout old
Earl, when he was got loose (he had been imprisoned),
hearing that the great favourite,
Buckingham, was drawn about with a coach
and six horses (which was wondered at then
as a novelty, and imputed to him as a mastering
pride), thought, if Buckingham had six, he
might very well have eight in his coach; with
which he rode through the city of London to
Bath, to the vulgar talk and admiration; and,
recovering his health there, he lived long after
at Petworth in Sussex; bating this over-topping
humour, which shewed it rather an affected fit
than a distemper.</p>

<p>"Nor did this addition of two horses, by
Buckingham, grow higher than a little murmur.
For in the late Queen's time (Elizabeth), there
were no coaches, and the First Lord had but
two horses; the rest crept in by degrees, as
men at first ventured to sea. And every new
thing the people disaffect, they stumble at;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
sometimes at the action of the parties, which
rises like a little cloud, but soon vanishes.</p>

<p>"So after, when Buckingham came to be
carried in a chair upon men's shoulders, the
clamour and noise of it was so extravagant
that the people would rail on him in the streets,
loathing that men should be brought to as
servile a condition as horses; so irksome is
every little new impression that breaks an old
custom, and rubs and grates against the public
humour; but when time had made those chairs
common, every minion used them; so that that
which gave at first so much scandal was the
means to convey those privately to such places,
where they might give much more. Just like
long hair, at one time described as abominable&mdash;another
time approved of as beautiful."</p>

<p class="title2">CHAPTER XVIII.</p>

<p>Few of my readers will remember the old
hackney-coaches, and fortunate are they
who live at a period when they can be driven
about the metropolis and throughout all the
principal towns in hansom cabs and "four-wheelers."
The old hackney-coach was usually
a broken-down, rickety vehicle, that had evidently
seen better days; it usually bore the arms
and crest of some noble family; the lining, torn
and faded, showed signs of former grandeur, as
did the harness, now patched and tied together
with string. The horses looked more fit to
furnish a meal for a pack of hungry foxhounds
than to go through their daily work. The
coachman, becaped and bebooted, was a long
time descending from and ascending his box,
and when seated there it required a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
amount of "ge-upping" and "go-alonging,"
with the additional aid of whipping, to get
his half-starved, broken-down animals into a
trot.</p>

<p>What a contrast to the Hansom of the present
day, which, generally speaking, is clean, admirably
horsed, and well driven, so much so that
the driver of a well-appointed two-wheeler, like
Tom Tug, in "The Waterman," "is never in
want of a <i>fare</i>!" Would that I could say
the same of the four-wheeler! There are
some exceptions; but the majority savour too
much of the old hackney-coach to merit a
eulogium.</p>

<p>Practical jokes have often been played
by persons representing highwaymen for the
time being; a most memorable one was
practised by the celebrated John Mytton, of
Halston.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion, a neighbouring clergyman
was invited to dine at the Squire's, as Mytton
was called, and in the course of the evening,
the conversation turned upon the knights of the
road. Whether this casual topic gave the idea
to the arch-hoaxer, or that the affair was premeditated,
I know not, but it was shortly carried
out. After a quiet rubber of whist, the Reverend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
gentleman's carriage was announced, and he took
his departure.</p>

<p>He had not proceeded a hundred yards
beyond the lodge-gate, when all of a sudden
the carriage stopped, and a man with a black
crape over his face presented a pistol, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Your money or your life," his companion,
equally disguised, catching hold of the
horses.</p>

<p>Unarmed, and alone, resistance was in
vain, he, therefore, gave his purse to the
marauder.</p>

<p>"This won't do," said the man. "I must
have your watch."</p>

<p>"Spare that," beseechingly implored the
clergyman. "It is of little value to anyone
but myself, and was the gift of a beloved
mother."</p>

<p>"No time for sentiment," continued the
other, "you must hand it out," at the same
time cocking the pistol.</p>

<p>The valued gift now changed hands, and the
Reverend gentleman was allowed to proceed
to his home in safety.</p>

<p>Early the next morning he applied to a magistrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
for assistance, and proceeded to Halston
to inform Mytton of the disgraceful state of
the country, when a man could be robbed
within a few yards of his lodge.</p>

<p>"I'll send for the constable," said Mytton,
"a reward shall be offered, and no exertion
shall be wanting on my part to trace the scoundrel
and get your property restored."</p>

<p>The clergyman was brimming over with
gratitude, when the Squire continued.</p>

<p>"Come and dine here to-morrow, and I'll
send an escort home with you. My keeper and
a watcher will be more than a match for any
two rascals that infest the road."</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted, and in the meantime
every exertion was made by the magistrate
to discover the offenders. During dinner,
the conversation naturally turned upon the
bare-faced robbery.</p>

<p>"I did not mind the fellows taking my money,"
said the victim. "Albeit I could not well
afford to lose it, but what I felt deeply was
the loss of my watch. I would give any sum
in my power to recover it."</p>

<p>At that moment the second course was put
on the table, for at the time I write of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dîners à la Russe</i> were unknown, and a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
dish with a cover over it was placed before the
host.</p>

<p>"I wish," said Mytton, addressing his clerical
friend, "you would kindly carve the pheasants.
I sprained my wrist out hunting last week, and
if I attempt the job, it will be a case of
'mangling done here.'"</p>

<p>The dish was removed and placed before
the clergyman, and upon the cover being taken
off, great was the delight and surprise of the
victim to find his purse and watch occupying
the place of the far-famed bird of
Colchis.</p>

<p>An angry look at the perpetrator of this
practical joke was soon transformed into a
smile, for the delight of recovering the watch
made him ample compensation for the anxiety
of mind he had suffered.</p>

<p>A hoax similar in some degree was practised
in France on the Baron de Bezenval.</p>

<p>This well-known nobleman was in 1788 on
a visit at the house of M. de Bercheni, beyond
La Ferté-sous-Jouare, an estate now belonging
to the family of Castellane. It was the latter
end of Autumn. Some bold poachers already
disturbed the sport. The wind blew violently,
and strewed the ground with leaves; the mornings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
were misty, the nights long, gloomy, and
cold; but gloom never approached the place
that the Baron inhabited. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">après-dîner</i> had
been excessively merry, and all the company
had gradually retired. M. de Bezenval had
announced his departure, and being almost the
only guest in the room, took leave of the mistress
of the house.</p>

<p>"I hope to see you again soon," said
he.</p>

<p>"I hope so too," replied the lady with
courtesy.</p>

<p>He took his departure, and soon fell asleep
in his post-chaise, wrapped up in thick fur.
He was suddenly roused from his slumbers by
a violent shaking. The postilion had been
knocked off his horse, a number of armed men
surrounded the vehicle, and their leader, whose
face was blackened, seizing the Baron, presented
a pistol to his breast.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the Baron, "your men do not
know how to behave themselves&mdash;they should
at least have given me time to draw my hunting-knife."</p>

<p>Without favouring him with a reply, they
stripped him&mdash;his cane, rings, snuff-boxes of
lapis-lazuli, and his two watches and chains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
decked with gems were wrested from him.</p>

<p>"Are you content?" cried Bezenval.</p>

<p>"No," replied they, "the chaise is ours, as
all the rest; get out of it."</p>

<p>He alighted, and the brigands dispersed, one
only mounting one of the horses, and driving
off at a gallop.</p>

<p>"Valentine, what is to be done?" said the
Baron to his servant.</p>

<p>"I really do not know," replied the latter;
"perhaps the wisest step is to go back to the
château."</p>

<p>Thither they turned, and two hours of most
fatiguing walking brought them to it. The
gates were open, there were no servants in the
courts, and none in the ante-rooms. He entered
the drawing-room, and not a soul was in it.
But what did his eyes first fall upon? His two
watches and their chains were hanging to the
chimney-piece! Whilst he was gazing on them,
immense shouts of laughter arose, and the
bandits of quality crowded into the room in
their several disguises. Such was the method
devised to bring back the agreeable Baron de
Bezenval.</p>

<p>Having described coaching in England, it
may not be uninteresting to give a brief notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
of French coaching. It is now two hundred
years ago that La Fontaine wrote the following
lines, which began his fable "La Coche et la
Mouche:&mdash;"</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Dans un chemin, montant, sablonneux, malaisé,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Et de tous les côtés au soleil exposé,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Six forts chevaux tiroient une coche."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At that time public and private vehicles had
not yet undergone any very notable improvements.
When an inhabitant of Bordeaux or
Maçon took his departure for Paris he made his
will, leaving among other things "son corps
à la diligence."</p>

<p>Eighty years previous, in the middle of the
sixteenth century, private vehicles were not
very numerous, if we judge by the predicament
in which Henry IV., King of France and
Navarre, found himself when he wrote to Sully,
"Je n'ai pas pu aller vous voir hier, ma
femme ayant pris ma coche." That <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coche</i>
which we in England still call coach, and the
driver of which has obtained the name of coacher&mdash;coachman
was either <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coche de terre</i> or a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coche d'eau</i>, both conveying travellers and
goods. The coche d'Auxerre alone survived
in France until our days. The steamboats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
have sunk it, in despite of its heroic resistance.
It was only in the first year of the seventeenth
century that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coches</i> or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voitures</i>, were first ornamented,
and provided with leather braces;
they then assumed the generic name of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carrosses</i>,
derived from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">char</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">charrette</i>.</p>

<p>It would occupy too much space to write a
history of their transformations and successive
improvements, and to follow step by step the
aristocratic succession of the carrosse, calêche,
berline, landau, dormeuse, char-à-banc, demi-fortune,
vis-à-vis, coupé, not omitting the cabriolet,
phaeton, boguey, tilbury, kibitka, britzska,
and other vehicles of the young fashion of all
times. The public vehicles have made slower
progress. The <i>diligences</i> long continued worthy
of their grandfathers the <i>coches</i>, and were
very unworthy of their new name.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the present century, in
which everything now moves on so rapidly, two
days and a night were still required to pass
from Paris to Orleans. Travellers slept on the
road at Etampes or Pithiviers, a spot rendered
immortal by Perlet's admirable personification in
"Le Comédien d'Etampes;" hotel living, with
its good fare and bad beds, being preferred to
highroad living, with its obligato accompaniment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
of broken down cattle, rickety coaches, and
highwaymen armed to the teeth. The diligences
gave birth to the messageries, chaises, chaises-de-poste,
and at a later period to the malle-postes,
which, however, did not prevent certain
provinces from enjoying a sort of progeniture
of ancient coches, under the various names of
voiturines, guimbardes, carrioles, and other instruments
of torture, which enabled the traveller
to accomplish easily, as the saying went,
"twenty leagues in fifteen days."</p>

<p>After that the real <i>diligences</i>, the real <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">messageries</i>,
attained a degree of comfort for which
the public were most grateful. To frequent
changes and improvement of the horses were
added the comfort of the vehicle; and last, not
least, the lowness of the prices. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malle-postes</i>,
destined for the more rapid conveyance
of letters, and at the same time of travellers
eager to get over their journey quickly&mdash;thanks
to the attention of the administration&mdash;were
rendered admirably adapted to the public service,
the primary object of their establishment,
and to the private service of those who wished
for comfort in their travels.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caisse</i> containing the despatches, the
high station occupied behind by the courrier-conducteur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
of the mail, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caisse</i> reserved for
travellers, the shape and size of which varied
according to the seasons, and the comfortable
seat for the passengers, deserved every praise.
What could a traveller in those days, when
steam was not in prospective existence, desire
more than to travel from Paris to Bayonne,
two hundred leagues, in fifty-six hours? The
humbler history of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacre</i> also deserves to
have a place here. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carrosse</i> gave birth to
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacre</i> in the seventeenth century. That
was the first coach devoted to public
use.</p>

<p>I have already said that the head-quarters
of these vehicles were in Rue St. Antoine,
Paris, and were called "carrosses à cinq
sous," five sous being the price for the hour.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiacres</i> long had a bad name, and not
undeservedly so. Who does not remember,
even in our days, the wretched equipages that
stood on the rank? Who has not had, at
least once in his life, a quarrel with the
drivers, often more vicious than their cattle?
The cabriolets for town and country, and the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coucous</i>, were scarcely superior in any respect,
as many have wofully experienced.</p>

<p>Times, however, have altered, and, during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
the last few years incredible improvements
have taken place, not only in the vehicles,
but also in the horses and their drivers. Transformations
almost as wonderful as that of
Cinderella's fairy carriage have been effected.
The carriages are better constructed and suspended,
and are arranged more comfortably
inside. The creation, too, of one-horse coupés
(broughams) has successfully provided for the
wants of the public, and at the present time a
vast number of new companies, under various
names, have vied in skill and conferred upon
the people vehicles of tasteful shapes, horses
in good condition, totally unlike the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rosses</i> of
former days, harness neat, drivers in uniform
liveries, and above all, civil and attentive.</p>

<p>To complete this sketch, let me pay a parting
tribute to the Parisian omnibus, that accommodating
carriage which takes you up at all hours,
at every moment, in the street or at your door,
and carries you without any delay to any street
or door you wish to alight at&mdash;sociable vehicles
which, for the trifling sum of thirty centimes,
convey you two leagues from the Barrière
de l'Etoile to that of the Trône, and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
the Madelaine to the Place de la Bastille.</p>

<p>Would that I had space to review all the
varieties of that obliging vehicle, which, it is
said, appeared at Nantes, before it invaded
the streets, quays, and boulevards of the capital!
Were I to enumerate the "Hirondelles,"
"Favorites," "Dames Françaises," "Parisiennes,"
"Beauvaises," "Orléannaises," &amp;c., and
point out all their graces and charms, it would
lead me on to the history of locomotion by
conveyance, and the celebration of steam, steamboats,
railroads, trains, and their marvellous
rapidity.</p>

<p>Let me conclude with this observation&mdash;namely,
that the number of vehicles of all sorts
which were wont daily to circulate in the streets
of Paris exceeded sixty-one thousand; the cabriolets,
hackney-coaches, diligences, and omnibusses&mdash;or,
as the erudite coachman called them
omnibii&mdash;amounted, out of the above number,
to twenty thousand. What they are at this
present moment I have no means of ascertaining.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the seventeenth
century there were not fifty carriages to be
seen in Paris; in the reign of Louis XIV.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
all the world possessed them, as they would
have been unable to present themselves
at court. No longer could they go to
the Palace on horses, although the privilege
was still allowed to certain Members
of Parliament. This, however, ceased entirely
about the middle of the reign of Louis
XIV.</p>

<p>The adoption of this general use of wheel
carriages produced a great change in the
habits of social life, and had much influence
on the political state of the country. The
state of public roads, which the necessity of
travelling on horseback imposes, must immediately
influence all military movements and
all communication of intelligence, must triple
the expense of all commercial transfers, and
prevent, or render difficult, all merely social
meetings, except between the nearest neighbours.</p>

<p>When Laporte, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de chambre</i> to
Anne of Austria, tells us that in the Winter
of the year 1636, between Piteaux and Paris,
on the route of Orleans, the road was so
bad that the Queen was obliged to sleep
in her carriage because neither the mules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
nor carts that carried her baggage could
possibly arrive, we may conceive how little
Winter travelling there could have been in
France.</p>

<p>Although coaches were already known and
used in Paris, they were so unlike the
modern vehicles of the same name that
the pleasures, engagements, and assignations
of the young men were still pursued on
horseback.</p>

<p>A printed paper is yet extant in the Royal,
or rather Republican Library at Paris, announcing
in all its details to the public the establishment
by Government of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-flambeaux</i> and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-lanternes</i>; persons provided with them
were to be posted at the Louvre, the Palais
de Justice, and in other public places at
Paris.</p>

<p>These extempore illuminations must have been
very necessary in the streets of a great town
still frequented by horsemen, where no aid of
light was derived either from the doors of
private houses or the windows of shops; the
habitual darkness only made more visible from
the occasional flambeaux carried before some
persons of distinction by their own servants,
or accompanying their coach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
This establishment of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-flambeaux</i>, which
was to take place in October, 1662, was announced
with all the forms of a long preamble,
and surrounded with all the exclusive privileges
which could have accompanied the most important
measure of internal government. It furnished
a curious example of the minute details
into which the hierarchy of despotic power had
already entered in France. It called itself "The
establishment of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-flambeaux</i>, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-lanternes</i>,
for the town and suburbs of Paris, and
other towns, by letters patent of the King,
approved of by Parliament, and the prices regulated
by this august body."</p>

<p>Then follows the orders, which forbid anybody
from carrying a "link," or "lantern," without
an express permission from the individual who
has obtained this privilege from the king, to
the exclusion of all others, under pain of a
thousand francs (£40) penalty. The price fixed
for the hire of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-lanterne</i> was three sous
a quarter of an hour, for persons who went on
foot; for those who went in carriages five
sous.</p>

<p>The public are then assured that the convenience
of being able to go out at night with lights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
will prove such a boon to all, more especially
to men of business and in trade, that the
streets will be more frequented, much to the
discomfiture of thieves and vagabonds. To
nightly depredators, the darkness of the streets
must have been very favourable, as we ourselves
know it is in London during a dense fog.
Thus we see Boileau makes one of the torments
of a town life the dread of thieves:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Que dans le marché neuf tout est calme et tranquille,</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Les voleurs à l'instant s'emparent,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Le bois le plus funeste, et le moins fréquenté,</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Est, au Prix de Paris, un lieu de sûreté,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Malheur donc à celui qu'une affaire imprévue</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Engage un peu tard au détours d'une rue,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Bientôt quatre bandits lui servant les côtés,</div>
<div class="line i1h">  La bourse, il faut se rendre."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It will thus be seen that the roads in
France, and streets in Paris, in bygone
days, were as bad as those of England and
London; for we find that frequent and fatal
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontres</i> took place from disturbances in the
streets.</p>

<p>The Prince de Conti and the Comte de
Soissons' coaches meeting in a narrow place
near the Louvre, by the bad driving of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
coachmen, jostled against each other, and came
to blows between their followers, who, departing
in that fashion one from another, did, against
the next morning call and assemble together
such numbers of their followers, as that the
Duke de Guise joining his brother-in-law, Prince
de Conti, and the Prince de Condé with the
Comte de Soissons, his uncle, they came out
into the streets with at least three or four
hundred mounted men.</p>

<p>In a record of that time, I find the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There do daily break forth new quarrels
between the nobility in this town (Paris), who
are here in greater numbers than usually have
been heretofore, whereof one being between
Monsieur d'Andelot and Monsieur Balagny was
presently taken up; and another fell out the
other day between Colonel d'Ornano and one
Monsieur St. André, who, fighting in the streets,
were both hurt, and to avoid the mischief
that might ensue from such meetings, the
gates of the town were for a time shut
up."</p>

<p>How long the monopoly of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-lanternes</i>
continued a profitable concern I know not;
but at the end of the reign of Louis XIV.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
the luxury of carriages was so universal that
riding among the young men was confined
entirely to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manége</i>, to hunting, and to
their military life. A change of dress had
indeed necessitated a change in their mode
of conveyance. The military costume was no
longer that of the Court; their boots and
cloaks had disappeared, except when with their
regiments; and the knots of ribbons, the short
sleeves, the long ruffles, the lace, fringe, and
embroidery, and the flowing periwigs now
general, were perfectly incompatible with
an evening drive from the Louvre to the
Marais.</p>

<p>I may here remark that the first English
stage-coach seen in France was launched at
Dieppe in the month of October, 1816. The
horses being put to, Mr. Plant, of London, a
coachman of about eighteen stone weight, and
a real John Bull, mounted the box, and astonished
the inhabitants as much by his dexterity
in cracking his whip as by the bulk of his person
for the burden of his horses. Away he
started for St. Denis amid the various grimaces
of the populace.</p>

<p>A company of London proprietors have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
obtained the permission of the authorities
to run English stage-coaches between St.
Denis and Paris. Three more of these
vehicles were on their route for the same
destination, with English coachmen and harness.</p>

<p>The success of the undertaking was far different
from what was expected, and after a
time the enterprise was abandoned, the Parisians
preferring their lumbering conveyances to
the well-appointed "drag."</p>

<p>In conclusion, I am delighted to find that the
love of coaching is not extinct, that at the
present time there are some admirably well-appointed
teams to be daily seen at the old
"White Horse Cellar," and that they are
yearly on the increase. We have the Brighton,
the Dorking, the Guildford, the Oxford, the
Tunbridge, the Windsor, and the Watford, with
cattle that would delight the eyes of a Pears,
were he alive to see them.</p>

<p>Both the amateur and professional "dragsmen"
do their work well, and during the
Summer season nothing will prove more agreeable
than the box-seat or an outside place on
one of the above mentioned coaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
I have now reached the last stage, and shall
throw aside the ribbons. I trust the journey
has been a pleasant one; if so, in the phraseology
of the road, I shall say, "I go no further.
Please remember the Coachman."</p>
